10.1016/j.cell.2025.08.038	Multiscale proteomic modeling reveals protein networks driving Alzheimer's	Wang E, Yu K, Cao J, Wang M, Katsel P, Song WM, Wang Z, Li Y, Wang X, Wang Q, Xu P, Yu G, Zhu L, Geng J, Habibi P, Qian L, Tuck T, Li A, Tcw J, Roussos P, Brennand KJ, Haroutunian V, Johnson ECB, Seyfried NT, Levey AI, Bennett DA, Peng J, Cai D, Zhang B	The molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common form of dementia, remain poorly understood. Proteomics offers a crucial approach to elucidating AD pathogenesis, as alterations in protein expression are more directly linked to phenotypic outcomes than changes at the genetic or transcriptomic level. In this study, we develop multiscale proteomic network models for AD by integrating large-scale matched proteomic and genetic data from brain regions vulnerable to the disease. These models reveal detailed protein interaction structures and identify putative key driver proteins (KDPs) involved in AD progression. Notably, the network analysis uncovers an	Cell	2025 Sep 25

Here, we demonstrate the presence of pseudo-synaptic connections between sensory nerve endings and cancer cells in an extracerebral cancer, i.e., pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). These synaptic sites exhibit a selective enrichment of the glutamatergic N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDA) receptor subunit NMDAR2D (GRIN2D) on the cancer cells, which turns PDAC cells responsive to neuron-derived glutamate and promotes tumor growth and spread. Intriguingly, neurons transform a subset of co-cultured PDAC cells into calcium-responsive cells via GRIN2D-type glutamate receptors at the neuron-cancer pseudo-synapses. We found that the expression of this subunit is due to the increased glutamate availability provided by sensory innervation in a neurotrophic feedforward loop. Moreover, interference with the glutamate-GRIN2D signaling at these neuron-cancer pseudo-synapses markedly improved survival in vivo. This discovery of peripheral cancer-neuron pseudo-synapses may provide an opportunity for cancer-neuroscience-instructed oncological therapies.	Cancer cell	2025 Sep 25
10.1016/j.ccell.2025.09.002	Ketogenic diet inhibits glioma progression by promoting gut microbiota-derived	Chen ML, He Y, Dong XH, Liu HF, Yan ZX, Lu XL, Miao QQ, Zhao QN, Zhang H, Luo L, Wang S, Li JY, Xiang DF, Lin Y, Li TR, Zhou XY, Zhou YY, Mao M, Zhang X, Wei H, Shi Y, Liu XD, Ping YF, Bian XW	The ketogenic diet (KD) is a potential therapeutic strategy for glioma; however, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Herein, we first identify that glioma patients exhibit a distinct gut microbial profile characterized by reduced butyrate-producing bacteria abundance, particularly R. faecis, along with decreased butyrate levels. Notably, KD reshapes the gut microbiota especially enriching A. muciniphila in a mucin-2-dependent manner, elevates butyrate production, and activates caspase-3 in microglia. These changes promote an anti-tumor microglial phenotype, ultimately suppressing glioma progression in mice. Crucially, KD's anti-glioma effect is notably abolished by antibiotics treatment; germ-free condition; or specific depletion of mucin-2, microglia, or microglial caspase-3. Furthermore, butyrate, A. muciniphila, R. faecis, or A. muciniphila plus R. faecis restores KD-induced microglial caspase-3 activation and the anti-tumor phenotype of microglia in antibiotics-treated or germ-free mice. These findings highlight that targeting the gut microbiota by KD or supplementing with butyrate could be an effective strategy for glioma therapy.	Cancer cell	2025 Sep 25
10.1016/j.cmet.2025.09.001	Catenibacteriummitsuokai promotes hepatocellular carcinogenesis by binding to	Zhang Y, Liu W, Wong CC, Song Q, Zhang X, Zhou Q, Ren X, Ren X, Xuan R, Zhao Y, Xu L, Li X, Xu L, Zhang X, Kuang M, Yu J	The role of gut microbes in the pathogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unclear. Here, we identified that Catenibacterium is enriched in both the feces and tumors of patients with HCC. C. mitsuokai accelerated HCC carcinogenesis in both conventional and germ-free mice. Furthermore, C. mitsuokai disrupted the gut barrier and translocated to the liver as live bacteria. Critically, the C. mitsuokai surface protein Gtr1/RagA interacts with the γ-catenin receptor on HCC cells, facilitating its attachment and colonization in the mouse liver. We further revealed that the pro-tumorigenic effect of C. mitsuokai depends on its secreted metabolite, quinolinic acid. Mechanistically, quinolinic acid binds to and activates the tyrosine kinase with immunoglobulin and epidermal growth factor homology domains 2 (TIE2) on HCC cells. Phosphorylated TIE2 subsequently activates the downstream oncogenic phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/AKT) pathway, thereby promoting HCC progression. In summary, C. mitsuokai disrupts the gut barrier, colonizes HCC cells via Gtr1/RagA-γ-catenin, and secretes quinolinic acid, which binds to TIE2 and drives the PI3K/AKT pathway to promote HCC development.

10.1111/ppe.12615	Acetaminophen use during pregnancy and the risk of attention deficit	Masarwa R, Platt RW, Filion KB	BACKGROUND: The association between acetaminophen use during pregnancy and the development of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in the offspring may be due to bias. OBJECTIVES: The primary objective was to assess the role of potential unmeasured confounding in the estimation of the association between acetaminophen use during pregnancy and the risk of ADHD, through bias analysis. The secondary objective was to assess the roles of selection bias and exposure misclassification. DATA SOURCES: We searched MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library up to December 2018. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: We included observational studies examining the association between acetaminophen use during pregnancy and the risk of ADHD. SYNTHESIS: We meta-analysed data across studies, using random-effects model. We conducted a bias analysis to studies that did not adjust for important confounders, to explore systematic errors related to unmeasured confounding, selection bias, and exposure misclassification. RESULTS: The search resulted in seven studies included in our meta-analysis. When adjusted estimates were pooled across all studies, the risk ratio (RR) for ADHD was 1.35 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.25, 1.46; I(2) = 48%). Sensitivity analysis for unmeasured confounding in this meta-analysis showed that a confounder of 1.69 on the RR scale would reduce to 10% the proportion of studies with a true effect size of RR >1.10. Unmeasured confounding bias analysis decreased the point estimate in five of the seven studies and increased in two studies, suggesting that the observed association could be confounded by parental ADHD. Unadjusted and bias-corrected risk ratios (bcRRs) were: RR = 1.34, bcRR = 1.13; RR = 1.51, bcRR = 1.17; RR = 1.63, bcRR = 1.38; RR = 1.44, bcRR = 1.17; RR = 1.16, bcRR = 1.18; RR = 1.25, bcRR = 1.05; and RR = 0.99, bcRR = 1.18. CONCLUSIONS: Bias analysis suggests that the previously reported association between acetaminophen use during pregnancy and an increased risk of ADHD in the offspring may be due to unmeasured confounding. Our ability to conclude a causal association is limited.	Paediatric and perinatal epidemiology	2020 May
10.1016/j.chroma.2018.01.015	Profiling of polyunsaturated fatty acids in human serum using off-line and	Gu WY, Liu MX, Sun BQ, Guo MQ, Wu JL, Li N	Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) play a pivotal role in the biological effects, and are the potential biomarkers for some diseases. However, the structural diversity and similarity, the low concentration, and the interference of high abundant endogenous components challenge the PUFAs profiling. Herein, a novel analytical approach, off-line and on-line solid phase extraction-nano-liquid chromatography-quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (off-line and on-line SPE-nano-LC-Q-TOF-MS), was established to monitor the PUFAs. The combination of off-line and on-line SPE removed most of impurities, and the recoveries ranged from 80.1% to 93.0% and the matrix effects were from 85.1% to 92.8%. Using this method, 51 PUFAs could be separated well and quantified with the limits of quantification between 0.006 and 2.2 pg. Finally, this developed method was applied successfully to simultaneously qualify and quantify the potential biomarkers in the allergic patients. 21 PUFAs including LTB(4,) 5S-, 11S-, 15S-HETE and 15S-HEPE showed significant differences. Our study indicated that the established method has the potential to sensitively and accurately determine the PUFAs in biological samples.	Journal of chromatography. A	2018 Feb 16
10.1016/j.cell.2018.05.051	Common Disease Is More Complex Than Implied by the Core Gene Omnigenic Model.	Wray NR, Wijmenga C, Sullivan PF, Yang J, Visscher PM	"The evidence that most adult-onset common diseases have a polygenic genetic architecture fully consistent with robust biological systems supported by multiple back-up mechanisms is now overwhelming. In this context, we consider the recent ""omnigenic"" or ""core genes"" model. A key assumption of the model is that there is a relatively small number of core genes relevant to any disease. While intuitively appealing, this model may underestimate the biological complexity of common disease, and therefore, the goal to discover core genes should not guide experimental design. We consider other implications of polygenicity, concluding that a focus on patient stratification is needed to achieve the goals of precision medicine."	Cell	2018 Jun 14
10.1111/sjop.12866	Relation between resilience and personality traits: The role of hopelessness and	Nieto M, Visier ME, Silvestre IN, Navarro B, Serrano JP, Martínez-Vizcaíno V	Resilience refers to the process by which individuals use the ability to cope with challenges to successfully adapt to adverse situations, inclining towards the future and hope. The main aim of this study was to analyze the relation between resilience, personality traits, and hopelessness. Furthermore, we conducted comparisons between two age groups: young and older adults. The sample comprised 439 Spanish participants (66.7% women; M = 43.73, SD = 26.41; age range = 18-98 years). The Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale, NEO-Five Factor Inventory, and Beck Hopelessness Scale were used to measure the main study variables. The results revealed a negative relation between resilience and neuroticism, and a positive association with the other personality traits. Additionally, levels of resilience were found to be negatively related to hopelessness. The group of older adults showed significantly lower resilience levels than the young adults, although age was not a significant predictor of resilience. Neuroticism, extraversion, openness, and hopelessness were the only predictors of resilience for the current study. This work contributes to the study of resilience and related factors, by attempting to understand the role of resilience and resistance to risk and how individuals tackle challenges over time, with important implications for mental health.

10.1186/s40364-025-00831-w	1-year risks of cancers associated with COVID-19 vaccination: a large	Kim HJ, Kim MH, Choi MG, Chun EM	The oncogenic potential of SARS-CoV-2 has been hypothetically proposed, but real-world data on COVID-19 infection and vaccination are insufficient. Therefore, this large-scale population-based retrospective study in Seoul, South Korea, aimed to estimate the cumulative incidences and subsequent risks of overall cancers 1 year after COVID-19 vaccination. Data from 8,407,849 individuals between 2021 and 2023 were obtained from the Korean National Health Insurance database. The participants were categorized into two groups based on their COVID-19 vaccination status. The risks for overall cancer were assessed using multivariable Cox proportional hazards models, and data were expressed as hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The HRs of thyroid (HR, 1.351; 95% CI, 1.206-1.514), gastric (HR, 1.335; 95% CI, 1.130-1.576), colorectal (HR, 1.283; 95% CI, 1.122-1.468), lung (HR, 1.533; 95% CI, 1.254-1.874), breast (HR, 1.197; 95% CI, 1.069-1.340), and prostate (HR, 1.687; 95% CI, 1.348-2.111) cancers significantly increased at 1 year post-vaccination. In terms of vaccine type, cDNA vaccines were associated with the increased risks of thyroid, gastric, colorectal, lung, and prostate cancers; mRNA vaccines were linked to the increased risks of thyroid, colorectal, lung, and breast cancers; and heterologous vaccination was related to the increased risks of thyroid and breast cancers. Given the observed associations between COVID-19 vaccination and cancer incidence by age, sex, and vaccine type, further research is needed to determine whether specific vaccination strategies may be optimal for populations in need of COVID-19 vaccination.

10.1016/j.cell.2025.09.001	Safe immunosuppression-resistant pan-cancer immunotherapeutics by velcro-like	Zhou RW, Purohit PK, Kim JH, Lee SU, Burshteyn N, Tifrea D, Cordon A, Grigorian A, Newton BL, Edwards RA, Demetriou M	"Bispecific antibodies and chimeric antigen receptor T cells are some of the most potent cancer immunotherapeutics in clinical use, yet most cancers remain poorly targetable. High-affinity antibodies required to maximize killing detect low antigen expression in normal tissue, risking ""on-target, off-cancer"" toxicity. This compels identification of cancer-restricted cell-surface protein antigens, which are rare. Tumor-associated carbohydrate antigens (TACAs) are the most abundant and widespread cancer antigens known but are poorly targetable by antibodies. Here, we describe glycan-dependent T cell recruiter (GlyTR) pan-cancer immunotherapeutics that utilize high-avidity ""velcro-like"" lectin binding to kill cells with high but not low TACA expression. GlyTR1 and GlyTR2 bind immunosuppressive β1,6GlcNAc-branched N-glycans or multiple TACAs (Tn, sialyl-Tn, LacDiNAc, and GD2), respectively, overcome immunosuppressive mechanisms in the tumor microenvironment and trigger target-density-dependent T cell-mediated pan-cancer killing, yet they lack toxicity in mice with human-like TACA expression. Density-dependent lectin binding to TACAs provides highly potent and safe pan-cancer immunotherapeutics."	Cell	2025 Sep 25
10.1016/j.jare.2025.09.039	Global, regional, and national burden of cardiovascular diseases among	Xu S, Jia S, Yang S, Li D, Zhang E, Lei F, Zeng ML, Lin L	BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) remain the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. In postmenopausal women, physiological changes and hormonal transitions accelerate cardiovascular risk, yet global, sex-specific evidence for this group remains limited. Understanding their burden is essential to address biological vulnerabilities and structural inequities. AIM OF REVIEW: This review provides the first comprehensive global, regional, and national assessment of CVD burden among women aged ≥ 55 years from 1990 to 2021 and projects trends to 2040. It synthesizes epidemiological patterns, socio-demographic disparities, and major modifiable risk factors, with the goal of informing gender-sensitive and equity-oriented cardiovascular prevention and policy strategies. KEY SCIENTIFIC CONCEPTS OF REVIEW: Data were obtained from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Study 2021, encompassing 204 countries and territories. Incidence, prevalence, mortality, and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) were analyzed using age-standardized rates (ASRs). Temporal trends were quantified with estimated annual percentage changes (EAPCs), and decomposition analysis identified demographic (population growth, aging) and epidemiological contributions. Inequalities were evaluated using slope and concentration indices across socio-demographic index (SDI) levels. Bayesian age-period-cohort models were applied to forecast CVD burden through 2040. Key findings indicate that although ASIR and ASMR declined globally, absolute CVD cases and deaths nearly doubled due to demographic expansion. Disparities widened: high-SDI regions achieved the steepest reductions, while low-SDI regions showed slower progress or worsening trends. Ischemic heart disease and stroke remained the dominant contributors, endocarditis was the fastest-rising subtype, and high systolic blood pressure consistently emerged as the leading modifiable risk factor. Collectively, these findings highlight a growing and uneven burden of CVD in postmenopausal women. Strengthened hypertension control, integrated prevention strategies, and investment in primary healthcare-particularly in low-SDI settings-are urgently needed. This review provides a woman-centered evidence base to support equitable cardiovascular health policy and resource allocation.	Journal of advanced research	2025 Sep 24

10.1186/s13045-025-01739-6	Combination immunotherapy in hepatocellular carcinoma: synergies among immune	Dai S, Chen Y, Cai W, Dong S, Zhao J, Chen L, Cheng CS	Combination therapy is rapidly becoming the cornerstone of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treatment. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have emerged as a central strategy in systemic therapy, yet their efficacy as monotherapies remains limited. Consequently, combinatorial approaches, such as ICIs-Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), ICIs-chemotherapy, and dual ICI regimens, are gaining momentum. While clinical trials have established efficacy benchmarks, mechanistic insights remain scarce, partly due to the limitations of current preclinical models in mimicking the complex tumor microenvironment (TME). Given the substantial heterogeneity of HCC, spanning genetic, transcriptomic, and immunologic dimensions, treatment outcomes vary widely. Additional factors such as gut microbiota and epigenetic modifications further influence therapeutic response and resistance. Although PD-1, PD-L1, and CTLA-4 inhibitors are widely used, unresponsiveness is common. Novel targets such as LAG-3, TIM-3, TIGIT, and VISTA, as well as strategies to reprogram fibrotic and immunosuppressive TME, are under active investigation. Ultimately, translating basic insights into personalized therapy will depend on predictive biomarkers and integrated analyses that account for the complex interactions among tumor cells, the immune system, and the TME. This review synthesizes current knowledge and cellular mechanisms underpinning combination therapies, highlights therapeutic synergies, and discusses emerging directions for stratified treatment in HCC.

10.1159/000480657	Geniposide Attenuates Post-Ischaemic Neurovascular Damage via GluN2A/AKT/	Huang B, Chen P, Huang L, Li S, Zhu R, Sheng T, Yu W, Chen Z, Wang T	BACKGROUND/AIMS: Calcium-permeable ionotropic NMDAR-mediated hyperactivity is regarded as the critical factor in modulating the development of ischaemic stroke. Recently, there has been increasing interest in preventing post-stroke neuronal death by focusing on intervening in the function of subpopulations of NMDARs and their downstream signalling. Geniposide, an iridoid glycoside, has been found to have cytoprotective functions in various conditions. However, it is still unclear whether and how geniposide affects neuronal insult under experimental stroke. METHODS: We demonstrate that dose-dependent geniposide significantly decreased the infarct volume in tMCAO models. RESULTS: A medium level of geniposide improved anti-apoptotic functions and inhibited BBB leakage/haemorrhage via elevating GluN2A-containing NMDAR expression in tMCAO rats. Importantly, these effects could be eliminated by co-treatment of geniposide with the GluN2A antagonist NVP but not the GluN2B inhibitor ifenprodil. Moreover, geniposide's protection was due to the enhancement of GluN2A-dependent survival signals, including pAKT, pERK and PSD-95. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that geniposide protects neurons against post-ischaemic neurovascular injury through the activation of GluN2A/AKT/ERK pathways. As a very promising natural agent, geniposide may be a future therapeutic for stroke patients.	Cellular physiology and biochemistry : international journal of experimental	2017
