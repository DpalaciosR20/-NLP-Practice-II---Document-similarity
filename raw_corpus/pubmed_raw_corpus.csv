10.2147/NSS.S467531	Effects of Acute Sleep Deprivation on Sporting Performance in Athletes: A	Gong M, Sun M, Sun Y, Jin L, Li S	OBJECTIVE: Using meta-analysis to comprehensively and quantitatively evaluate the impact of acute sleep deprivation on different sports performance of athletes, this study aims to provide scientific guidance for coaches in optimizing and adjusting training and competition arrangements. METHODS: Establishing literature inclusion and exclusion criteria, we conducted searches in both Chinese and English databases. Using stata 14.0, we analyzed 75 indicators from 27 included literature, focusing on three aspects: the impact of acute sleep deprivation on overall athletic performance, the impact on sporting performance across various athletic abilities, and the disparities in athletic performance between morning and afternoon following acute sleep deprivation. RESULTS: The effect size of acute sleep deprivation on overall athletic performance was -0.56 (P<0.05). Sub-analyses revealed effect sizes of -0.23 (P<0.05) for whole night sleep deprivation, -1.17 (P<0.05) for partial sleep deprivation at the end of the night, and -0.25 (P>0.05) for partial sleep deprivation in the beginning of the night. The effect sizes of acute sleep deprivation on high intensity intermittent exercise, skill control, speed, aerobic endurance, and explosive power indicators were -1.57, -1.06, -0.67, -0.54, and -0.39 respectively (P<0.05). The effect sizes of acute sleep deprivation on the overall athletic performance in the morning and afternoon were -0.30, and -1.11, respectively (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: Acute sleep deprivation significantly impairs the overall athletic performance of athletes, with a more pronounced negative impact observed with partial sleep deprivation at the end of the night. Various types of exercise performance are adversely affected by acute sleep deprivation, with magnitude of impact ranking high intensity intermittent, skill control, speed, aerobic endurance, and explosive power. Following acute sleep deprivation, athletes' overall sporting performance in the afternoon is inferior to that in the morning.	Nature and science of sleep	01/01/2024
10.1016/j.drudis.2013.04.001	Sclerostin: how human mutations have helped reveal a new target for the treatment	Robinson MK, Caminis J, Brunkow ME	In the 1990s there was a tremendous mood of optimism among pharmaceutical scientists that identification of disease-associated variations in the human genome would result in a surge of new drug targets (the 'gene-to-drug' mantra). To date the expected deluge of new drugs has not arrived. However, a small number of drugs arising directly from the study of rare human disorders showing Mendelian inheritance are now entering late stage clinical trials. Here we describe the advantages of this approach and discuss the background and early clinical trial findings with antibodies directed at a target identified in this way.

Michaelis T, Lindestam Arlehamn CS, Johansson E, Frazier A, Berry JD, Cudkowicz M, Goyal NA, Fournier C, Snyder A, Kwan JY, Crook J, Phillips EJ, Mallal SA, Ravits J, Marder KS, Sidney J, Sulzer D, Sette A	Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by a progressive loss of motor neurons. Neuroinflammation is apparent in affected tissues, including increased T cell infiltration and activation of microglia, particularly in the spinal cord(1,2). Autoimmune responses are thought to have a key role in ALS pathology, and it is hypothesized that T cells contribute to the rapid loss of neurons during disease progression(3,4). However, until now there has been no reported target for such an autoimmune response. Here we show that ALS is associated with recognition of the C9orf72 antigen, and we map the specific epitopes that are recognized. We show that these responses are mediated by CD4(+) T cells that preferentially release IL-5 and IL-10, and that	Nature	01/10/2025

Recent findings highlight a pivotal role for TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) in forming axonal pathological condensates and facilitating NMJ disruption through inhibition of local protein synthesis. However, the mechanisms that drive local TDP-43 accumulation remain unknown. Here we identify that the TDP-43 axonal accumulation in peripheral nerves of SOD1 patients and mice stems from its aberrant local synthesis. This is a non-cell-autonomous process driven by muscle-derived miR-126a-5p extracellular vesicles (EVs). Inhibiting muscle secretion of miR-126a-5p prompts presynaptic	Nature neuroscience	03/10/2025
10.1038/s41573-025-01291-5	In vivo chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy.	Bot A, Scharenberg A, Friedman K, Guey L, Hofmeister R, Andorko JI, Klichinsky M, Neumann F, Shah JV, Swayer AJ, Trudeau K, Weissman D, Stephan MT, Buchholz CJ, June CH	Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy has transformed the outcomes of patients with haematological malignancies, yet its use is limited by labour-intensive manufacturing, constrained production capacity and variable clinical performance. In vivo CAR-T cell engineering, in which CAR-T cells are generated directly inside the patient's body, seeks to overcome these challenges by eliminating the need for ex vivo cell processing and complex logistics, as well as improve clinical performance. Recent advances in virology, RNA medicines and nanotechnology have catalysed a radical overhaul of this approach, which uses targeted delivery systems such as lentiviral vectors and lipid nanoparticles to introduce CAR-encoding genetic material into endogenous T cells. Early clinical studies have shown efficient transduction, sustained CAR expression and initial signs of antitumour activity, establishing proof of concept. This Review explores the underlying technologies - including RNA delivered by lipid nanoparticles and engineered viral vectors - and discusses how they are being adapted to develop more broadly applicable, scalable, safe and effective CAR-T cell therapies. By removing the need for ex vivo manipulation and chemotherapeutic conditioning, this strategy could enable the wider application of CAR-T cell therapies not just to blood cancers but to autoimmune diseases for which ex vivo CAR-T cell therapies have shown strong promise, such as systemic lupus erythematosus.

10.1016/j.jns.2024.123303	Multi-Omic characterization of the effects of Ocrelizumab in patients with	Kornilov SA, Price ND, Gelinas R, Acosta J, Brunkow ME, Gervasi-Follmar T, Winger RC, Aldershoff D, Lausted C, Troisch P, Smith B, Heath JR, Repovic P, Cohan S, Magis AT	The study examined changes in the plasma proteome, metabolome, and lipidome of N = 14 patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) initiating treatment with ocrelizumab, assayed at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months. Analyses of >4000 circulating biomarkers identified depletion of B-cell associated proteins as the early effect observed following ocrelizumab (OCR) initiation, accompanied by the reduction in plasma abundance of cytokines and cytotoxic proteins, markers of neuronaxonal damage, and biologically active lipids including ceramides and lysophospholipids, at 6 months. B-cell depletion was accompanied by decreases in B-cell receptor and cytokine signaling but a pronounced increase in circulating plasma B-cell activating factor (BAFF). This was followed by an upregulation of a number of signaling and metabolic pathways at 12 months. Patients with higher baseline brain MRI lesion load demonstrated both higher levels of cytotoxic and structural proteins in plasma at baseline and more pronounced biomarker change trajectories over time. Digital cytometry identified a putative increase in myeloid cells and a pro-inflammatory subset of T-cells. Therapeutic effects of ocrelizumab extend beyond CD20-mediated B-cell lysis and implicate metabolic reprogramming, juxtaposing the early normalization of immune activation, cytokine signaling and metabolite and lipid turnover in periphery with changes in the dynamics of immune cell activation or composition. We identify BAFF increase following CD20 depletion as a tentative compensatory mechanism that contributes to the reconstitution of targeted B-cells, necessitating further research.

10.1038/s41591-025-03978-z	A systematic review and meta-analysis of the efficacy and safety of	McGowan B, Ciudin A, Baker JL, Busetto L, Dicker D, Frühbeck G, Goossens GH, Monami M, Sbraccia P, Martinez-Tellez B, Woodward E, Yumuk V	This systematic review and network meta-analysis evaluated the efficacy and safety of obesity management medications (OMMs) in terms of reducing body weight and impact on obesity-related complications. Here a Medline and Embase search was performed up to 31 January 2025 for randomized controlled trials comparing OMMs versus placebo/active comparators in adults. Primary endpoint was percentage of total body weight loss (TBWL%) at the end of the study. Secondary endpoints were TBWL% at 1, 2 and ≥3 years, lipid profile, blood pressure, hemoglobin A1c, fasting plasma glucose, mental health, serious adverse events, quality of life, cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, remission of obesity-related complications and all-cause mortality. Fifty-six clinical trials were identified-orlistat (22), semaglutide (14), liraglutide (11), tirzepatide (6), naltrexone/bupropion (5) and phentermine/topiramate (2)-enrolling 60,307 patients (32,598 OMM and 27,709 placebo). All OMMs showed a significantly greater TBWL% versus placebo (P < 0.0001), more than 10% for semaglutide and tirzepatide. Both tirzepatide and semaglutide showed normoglycemia restoration, remission of type 2 diabetes and reduction in hospitalization due to heart failure. Semaglutide was effective in reducing major adverse cardiovascular events and reducing pain in knee osteoarthritis. Tirzepatide was effective in remission of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis. These results support the need to individualize the selection of OMMs.	Nature medicine	02/10/2025
10.1126/science.adr7403	Intercellular communication in the brain through a dendritic nanotubular network.	Chang M, Krüssel S, Parajuli LK, Kim J, Lee D, Merodio A, Kwon J, Okabe S, Kwon HB	Intercellular nanotubular networks mediate material exchange, but their existence in neurons remains to be explored in detail. We identified long, thin dendritic filopodia forming direct dendrite-dendrite nanotubes (DNTs) in mammalian cortex. Super-resolution microscopy in dissociated neurons revealed DNTs' actin-rich composition and dynamics, enabling long-range calcium ion (Ca(2+)) propagation. Imaging and machine learning-based analysis validated in situ DNTs as anatomically distinct from synaptic spines. DNTs actively transported small molecules and human amyloid-β (Aβ); DNT density increased before plaque formation in the medial prefrontal cortex of APP/PS1 mice (APP, Aβ precursor protein; PS1, presenilin-1), suggesting that the dendrite-DNT network might play a role in Alzheimer's disease pathology. Computational models of DNT-mediated Aβ propagation recapitulated early amyloidosis, predicting selective intracellular accumulation. These findings uncover a nanotubular connectivity layer in the brain, extending neuronal communication beyond classical synapses.	Science (New York, N.Y.)	02/10/2025
10.1126/science.adu4235	Localized glutamine leakage drives the spatial structure of root microbial	Tsai HH, Tang Y, Jiang L, Xu X, Dénervaud Tendon V, Pang J, Jia Y, Wippel K, Vacheron J, Keel C, Andersen TG, Geldner N, Zhou F	Plant roots release exudates to encourage microbiome assembly, which influences the function and stress resilience of plants. How specific exudates drive spatial colonization patterns remains largely unknown. In this study, we demonstrate that endodermal Casparian strips-forming the root's extracellular diffusion barrier-restrict nutrient leakage into the rhizosphere, coinciding with and controlling spatial colonization patterns of rhizobacteria. We find that vasculature-derived glutamine leakage is a major bacterial chemoattractant and enhancer of proliferation, defining a previously unknown pathway for root exudate formation. Bacteria defective in amino acid chemoperception display reduced attraction toward leakage sites, and roots with Casparian strip defects display bacterial overproliferation, dependent on bacterial capacity for amino acid metabolization. Associated chronic immune stimulation suggests that endodermal nutrient restriction is crucial for regulating microbial colonization and assembly, limiting excessive proliferation that could compromise plant health.

Ramsdell F, Ziegler SF	It has been 65 years since the scurfy mutation arose spontaneously in mice at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in the United States, and it is 13 years since the molecular cloning of the forkhead box P3 (FOXP3) gene was reported. In this Timeline article, we review the events that have occurred during and since this time. This is not meant as an exhaustive review of the biology of FOXP3 or of regulatory T cells, rather it is an attempt to highlight the landmark events that have demonstrated the importance of FOXP3 in immune function. These events have driven, and continue to drive, the extensive research effort to fully understand the role of regulatory T cells in the immune system.	Nature reviews. Immunology	01/05/2014

In the present study, we aimed to examine the expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) related to BCBM in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues to identify their usefulness as predictive biomarkers of breast cancer brain recurrence (BCBR). METHODS: Pairs of primary breast and metastatic site tissue samples were collected from 38 patients who experienced the first recurrence of metastasis to a single distant organ (brain/lungs/liver/bones = 11/12/9/6 patients) between January 2007 and December 2021 at five institutions in Japan. We evaluated the expression of 15 miRNAs in FFPE specimens of untreated breast and metastatic sites from the same patient using quantitative polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Analysis of the selected 15 miRNAs revealed that hsa-miR-155-5p exhibited significant BCBR-specific overexpression in untreated primary breast tissues (p < 0.001). Two other miRNAs, hsa-miR-150-5p and hsa-miR-20b-5p, exhibited moderate (ρ = 0.587) and weak (ρ = 0.350) positive correlations with hsa-miR-155-5p, respectively. The BCBR prediction model demonstrated a high discrimination ability for hsa-miR-155-5p (AUC = 0.960). The localization of hsa-miR-155-5p in primary breast cancer tissue by in situ hybridization confirmed that hsa-miR-155-5p was uniformly stained in the breast cancer cells. CONCLUSIONS: Hsa-miR-155-5p expression in untreated primary breast tissue may be a valuable biomarker for predicting BCBR. A personalized escalation strategy is expected to be helpful in conquering brain metastases.	Breast cancer research : BCR	29/09/2025
10.1186/s12933-025-02939-7	Joint effects of triglyceride glucose index and its obesity-related derivatives	Ruan X, Ling Y, Chen J, Xiang Y, Ruan H, Zhang W, Jing L, Gao X, He Y, Lu X, Chang T, Xu J, Chen J	BACKGROUND: The triglyceride-glucose (TyG) index, TyG-body mass index (TyG-BMI), TyG-waist circumference (TyG-WC), TyG-waist-to-height ratio (TyG-WHtR), and estimated glucose disposal rate (eGDR) serve as surrogate markers of insulin resistance (IR) and are associated with cardiometabolic diseases (CMDs). However, the joint effects of TyG-related indices and eGDR on cardiometabolic multimorbidity (CMM) risk remains unclear. This study aims to assess both separate and combined effects of TyG-related indices and eGDR on CMM. METHODS: The data of this study derived from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS). TyG-related indices and eGDR were dichotomized at their median levels for participant categorization. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression and restricted cubic splines (RCS) analyzed effects of TyG-related indices and eGDR on CMM, while receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, net reclassification improvement (NRI) and integrated discrimination improvement (IDI) assessed their predictive performance. Meanwhile, the mutual mediating effects and interaction effects were further assessed. RESULTS: This study included 5,854 participants (male: 47.5%, median age: 57.0 years). Compared to low TyG-related indices plus high eGDR, High TyG-related indices plus low eGDR had elevated CMM risks: TyG (HR 3.59, 95% CI 2.28-5.65), TyG-BMI (HR 3.40, 95% CI 2.30-5.02), TyG-WC (HR 3.85, 95% CI 2.58-5.75), and TyG-WHtR (HR 3.62, 95% CI 2.43-5.39). Furthermore, the addition of TyG-related indices combined with eGDR to the basic model significantly improved CMM risk prediction: TyG (AUC 0.713, NRI 0.363, IDI 0.008, all p < 0.05); TyG-BMI (AUC 0.729, NRI 0.479, IDI 0.011, all p < 0.05); TyG-WC (AUC 0.716, NRI 0.419, IDI 0.010, all p < 0.05); and TyG-WHtR (AUC 0.717, NRI 0.379, IDI 0.010, all p < 0.05). Moreover, the mediation analysis demonstrated that eGDR significantly mediated all TyG-related indices' associations with CMM, with only obesity-related TyG indices mediating the association between eGDR and CMM. Notably, no significant additive or multiplicative interaction was observed between any TyG-related indices and eGDR for CMM risk. CONCLUSIONS: High TyG-related indices and low eGDR were independently and jointly associated with higher CMM risk. Joint application of TyG-related indices and eGDR could improve early identification and prevention of CMM.	Cardiovascular diabetology	02/10/2025
10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2025.35573	Cardiovascular Health Changes in Young Adults and Risk of Later-Life	Guo JW, Ning H, Allen NB, Perak AM, Walker JM, Pettee Gabriel K, Lloyd-Jones DM	IMPORTANCE: Associations of midlife cardiovascular health (CVH), measured once, with incident cardiovascular disease (CVD) are well described. Less is known about patterns of young adulthood CVH, including its changes and associations with later-life CVD outcomes. OBJECTIVE: To model patterns of change in population-level and individual-level CVH through young adulthood and to assess whether they are associated with incident CVD in later life. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study is a prospective longitudinal cohort study that enrolled Black and White participants at ages 18 to 30 years in 1985 and 1986 with subsequent follow-up examinations during the next 35 years at 4 urban US centers. Participants with at least 3 CVH measurements in young adulthood and subsequent follow-up with assessment of incident CVD events were included. Analyses were conducted from October 26, 2023, to May 15, 2024. EXPOSURES: CVH was measured using the American Heart Association Life's Essential 8 score. Patterns of CVH change in young adulthood (from examinations at years 0 to 20) were modeled with population-level trajectories and assessed by individual-level CVH status changes. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Incident CVD (myocardial infarction, heart failure, stroke, coronary revascularization, and CVD death) after year 20. RESULTS: There were 4241 participants in young adulthood (2354 [55.5%] female, 2042 [48.1%] self-identified as Black and 2199 [51.9%] self-identified as White) with a mean (SD) baseline age of 24.9 (3.6) years. In the trajectory analysis, 4 distinct CVH trajectory patterns were identified. Compared with the persistently high CVH trajectory, the moderate-to-low declining and moderate declining CVH trajectories had substantially higher risk for incident CVD. AHRs for incident CVD events ranged from 2.15 (95% CI, 1.04-4.47) in the persistently moderate pattern to 9.96 (95% CI, 4.75-20.86) in the moderate-to-low declining pattern. In the CVH status change analysis (n = 2857), compared with stable moderate CVH in young adulthood, stable high CVH had a lower risk (adjusted hazard ratio [AHR], 0.25 [95% CI, 0.09-0.69]), and stable low CVH had a higher risk (AHR, 5.91 [95% CI, 2.38-14.66]) for incident CVD. Each 10-point decrease in Life's Essential 8 score between years 0 and 20 was associated with a 53% increase in CVD risk (AHR, 1.53 [95% CI, 1.31-1.78]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this prospective cohort study of young adults, unfavorable patterns of CVH change through young adulthood were associated with marked elevations in risk for incident CVD. These data suggest that achieving and maintaining high CVH throughout young adulthood through strategies of primordial prevention are important for prevention of later-life CVD.

10.1016/j.immuni.2025.09.011	Obesity, diabetes, and inflammation: Pathophysiology and clinical implications.	Donath MY, Drucker DJ	Obesity and its related disorders, including type 2 diabetes and liver, kidney, and cardiovascular diseases, are now recognized as chronic inflammatory conditions. Here, we review the mechanisms underlying inflammation in these settings and how they may contribute to pathology. Nutrient excess triggers immune activation through pattern recognition receptors and the NLRP3 inflammasome, leading to interleukin (IL)-1β production and downstream cytokine cascades. Initially adaptive, this inflammation promotes tissue remodeling and metabolic compensation, but chronic activation contributes to insulin resistance, β cell dysfunction, and end-organ damage. We discuss the current therapeutic options, with a focus on glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists, which, alone or combined with additional bioactive moieties, exert notable anti-inflammatory effects. Some effects of GLP-1 medicines are independent of glucose control or weight loss, and they are attributed to direct signaling via the immune GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) and, indirectly, via central nervous system circuits. Understanding these mechanisms may unlock further therapeutic potential in chronic inflammatory diseases.	Immunity	03/10/2025

This cell state is caused by persistent antigen exposure, suboptimal co-stimulation and a plethora of hostile factors that dampen protective immunity and limit the efficacy of immunotherapies(1-4). The mechanisms that underlie T cell exhaustion remain poorly understood. Here we analyse the proteome of CD8(+) exhausted T (T(ex)) cells across multiple states of exhaustion in the context of both chronic viral infections and cancer. We show that there is a non-stochastic pathway-specific discordance between mRNA and protein dynamics between T effector (T(eff)) and T(ex) cells. We identify a distinct proteotoxic stress response (PSR) in T(ex) cells, which we term T(ex)-PSR. Contrary to canonical stress responses that induce a reduction in protein synthesis(5,6), T(ex)-PSR involves an increase in global translation activity and an upregulation of specialized chaperone proteins. T(ex)-PSR is further characterized by the accumulation of protein aggregates and stress granules and an increase in autophagy-dominant protein catabolism. We establish that disruption of proteostasis alone can convert T(eff) cells to T(ex) cells, and we link T(ex)-PSR mechanistically to persistent AKT signalling. Finally, disruption of T(ex)-PSR-associated chaperones in CD8(+) T cells improves cancer immunotherapy in preclinical models. Moreover, a high T(ex)-PSR in T cells from patients with cancer confers poor responses to clinical immunotherapy. Collectively, our findings indicate that T(ex)-PSR is a hallmark and a mechanistic driver of T cell exhaustion, which raises the possibility of targeting proteostasis pathways as an approach for cancer immunotherapy.

By using a chemical mutagenesis strategy in mice, we identified a pedigree that has a complete block in B cell development at the pre-B cell stage resulting from a deletion in the Fnip1 gene. Enforced expression of an immunoglobulin transgene failed to rescue B cell development. Whereas essential pre-B cell signaling molecules were activated normally in Fnip1-null pre-B cells, the metabolic regulators AMPK and mTOR were dysregulated, resulting in excessive cell growth and enhanced sensitivity to apoptosis in response to metabolic stress (pre-B cell receptor crosslinking, oncogene activation). These results indicate that Folliculin-interacting protein 1 (Fnip1) is vital for B cell development and metabolic homeostasis and reveal a metabolic checkpoint that may ensure that pre-B cells have sufficient metabolic capacity to support division, while limiting lymphomagenesis caused by deregulated growth.

Its effects in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension within the first year after diagnosis are unclear. METHODS: In this phase 3 trial, we enrolled adult patients with World Health Organization functional class II or III pulmonary arterial hypertension who had received the diagnosis less than 1 year earlier, had an intermediate or high risk of death, and were receiving double or triple background therapy. Patients were randomly assigned to receive add-on therapy with subcutaneous sotatercept (starting dose, 0.3 mg per kilogram of body weight; escalated to target dose, 0.7 mg per kilogram) or placebo every 21 days. The primary end point was clinical worsening, a composite of death from any cause, unplanned hospitalization lasting at least 24 hours for worsening of pulmonary arterial hypertension, atrial septostomy, lung transplantation, or deterioration in performance in exercise testing due to pulmonary arterial hypertension, assessed in a time-to-first-event analysis. RESULTS: The trial was stopped early owing to loss of clinical equipoise after the reporting of positive results from previous sotatercept trials. A total of 320 patients were included (160 each in the sotatercept and placebo groups). The median duration of follow-up was 13.2 months. At least one primary end-point event occurred in 17 patients (10.6%) in the sotatercept group and in 59 patients (36.9%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.24; 95% confidence interval, 0.14 to 0.41; P<0.001). Deterioration in performance in exercise testing due to pulmonary arterial hypertension occurred in 8 patients (5.0%) in the sotatercept group and in 46 patients (28.8%) in the placebo group; unplanned hospitalization for worsening of pulmonary arterial hypertension occurred in 3 patients (1.9%) and 14 patients (8.8%), respectively; and death from any cause occurred in 7 patients (4.4%) and 6 patients (3.8%). No cases of atrial septostomy or lung transplantation occurred. The most common adverse events with sotatercept were epistaxis (31.9%) and telangiectasia (26.2%). CONCLUSIONS: Among adults with pulmonary arterial hypertension who had received the diagnosis less than 1 year earlier, the addition of sotatercept to background therapy resulted in a lower risk of clinical worsening than placebo.

10.1016/j.cell.2025.08.033	Epithelial-mesenchymal transition.	Zhang CX, Huang RY, Sheng G, Thiery JP	Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a fundamental mechanism involved in the morphogenesis of metazoans. Through this evolutionarily conserved multi-stage process, cells acquire quasi-epithelial to multiple intermediate morphologies with epithelial and mesenchymal attributes, rarely reaching a complete mesenchymal phenotype. Complex evolutionary-conserved morphogenetic movements in gastrulation are described extensively, as they exemplify the extent of epithelial cell plasticity in the animal kingdom. Nonetheless, a single-gene knockout can modify the mode of gastrulation while achieving the same body plan. Numerous interconnected mechanisms drive different degrees of EMT, including surface receptor signaling, metabolism, and epigenetics. EMT is reactivated in adult tissues during repair and disease, particularly in cancer initiation, progression to metastasis, and refractoriness to treatment. EMT also contributes to dormancy and drug tolerance, leading to minimal residual disease at the origin of recurrences. Multiple EMT states coexist in tumors, creating a dynamic ecosystem for generating an inflammatory microenvironment, stemness, invasion, and metastasis. This review provides an in-depth description of these aspects along with recent controversies and offers new opportunities to further explore the multiple functions of EMT. Examining the potential attributes of EMT in tissue repair, fibrosis, and cancer progression can provide new opportunities for therapeutic intervention.	Cell	02/10/2025

They then translocated to the central nervous system (CNS) in EAE where they promoted disease severity. Notch3 interacted with delta-like ligand 1 (DLL1) on microglia to subvert Treg cells into T helper 17 (Th17) cells. Notch3 deletion in Treg cells prevented EAE onset by stabilizing Treg cells and by simultaneously promoting the expansion of a tissue-resident Treg cell population that expressed neuropeptide Y receptor 1 (NPY1R) and which suppressed pathogenic IFN-γ(+) and	Immunity	02/10/2025

Using parallel in-pool profiling of Cas9-induced insertions and deletions (indels) within a genome-wide knockout library, we present a comprehensive catalog that assesses the influence of nearly every human gene on DSB repair outcomes. This REPAIRome resource uncovers uncharacterized mechanisms, pathways, and factors involved in DSB repair, including opposing roles for XLF and PAXX, a molecular explanation for Cas9-induced multinucleotide insertions, HLTF functions in Cas9-induced DSB repair, the involvement of the SAGA complex in microhomology-mediated end joining, and an indel mutational signature linked to VHL loss, renal carcinoma, and hypoxia. These results exemplify the potential of REPAIRome to drive future discoveries in DSB repair, CRISPR-Cas gene editing and the etiology of cancer mutational signatures.

10.36401/JQSH-23-28	Factors Affecting Pregnancy Complications in Ghana.	Wiafe YK, Asamoah A, Akweongo P, Kumah A	INTRODUCTION: The prevalence of maternal mortality continues to be a significant health concern across the world. In Ghana, pregnancy-related complications in the previous 5 years account for 12% of all deaths among women 15 to 49 years. More than half of these deaths were avoidable if early assessment had been done. However, assessment of the pooled prevalence of pregnancy-related complications among pregnant women to inform policy is limited. This study sought to determine the factors contributing to pregnancy complications in Ghana. METHODS: Using a systematic sampling technique, a facility-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 415 pregnant women who attended antenatal care (ANC) services at Mamprobi Hospital. Bivariate and multiple logistics regression analyses were conducted to test significant factors determining pregnancy complications. The results of regression analysis are reported in odds ratio. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. RESULTS: The mean age of the participants was 31.6 ± 6.6 years. The incidence of pregnancy complications among the pregnant women was 51.8% (95% CI, 0.47-0.56) The incidence of pregnancy complications among the women was significantly determined by age (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 6.1; CI, 1.19-30.76), record of pregnancy complication (AOR, 2.5; CI, 1.35-4.49), ANC visit (AOR, 6.1; CI, 2.14-17.70), and family history of pregnancy complication (AOR, 3.6; CI, 1.25-10.40). Other significant factors included a record of abortion (AOR, 7.8; CI, 4.21-14.32), knowledge about obstetric danger signs (AOR, 2.4; CI, 1.21-4.88), and experiencing at least one obstetric danger sign during pregnancy (AOR, 6.6; CI, 3.30-13.29). CONCLUSION: The incidence of pregnancy complications was comparatively high among the women who used ANC services at Mamprobi Hospital. Early initiation of ANC services for pregnant women is an essential tool for addressing some of the challenges of early onset of some pregnancy complications, including anemia in pregnancy and preeclampsia. Midwives and other health workers who engage pregnant women should encourage their clients to initiate ANC visits at an early stage.	Global journal on quality and safety in healthcare	01/11/2024
10.1038/s41571-025-01077-z	The tumour microenvironment in pancreatic cancer - new clinical challenges, but	Kung HC, Zheng KW, Zimmerman JW, Zheng L	Patients with advanced-stage pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) predominantly receive chemotherapy, and despite initial responses in some patients, most will have disease progression and often dismal outcomes. This lack of clinical effectiveness partly reflects not only cancer cell-intrinsic factors but also the presence of a tumour microenvironment (TME) that precludes access of both systemic therapies and circulating immune cells to the primary tumour, as well as supporting the growth of PDAC cells. Combined with improved preclinical models of PDAC, advances in single-cell spatial multi-omics and machine learning-based models have provided novel methods of untangling the complexities of the TME. In this Review, we focus on the desmoplastic stroma and both the intratumoural and intertumoural heterogeneity of PDAC, with an emphasis on cancer-associated fibroblasts and their surrounding immune cell niches. We describe new approaches in converting the immunologically 'cold' PDAC TME into a 'hot' TME by priming T cell activation, overcoming T cell exhaustion and unravelling myeloid cell-mediated immunosuppression. Furthermore, we explore integrated targets involving the TME, such as points of convergence among tumour, stromal and immune cell metabolism as well as oncogenic KRAS signalling. Finally, building on our experience with failed clinical trials in the past, we consider how this evolving comprehensive understanding of the TME will ensure future success in developing more effective therapies for patients with PDAC.

Thus, enhancing energy dissipation through increased respiration holds significant therapeutic potential for metabolic disorders. Through a comprehensive analysis of human and murine adipose tissues, along with a functional screen, we identify mitochondrial carrier homolog 2, a mitochondrial outer membrane protein, as a pivotal regulator of mitochondrial metabolism. Intriguingly, its expression in adipose tissue is a strong determinant of obesity in humans. Adipocyte-specific ablation of mitochondrial carrier homolog 2 improves mitochondrial function and whole-body energy expenditure, independent of uncoupling protein 1. Furthermore, mitochondrial carrier homolog 2 regulates mitochondrial influx of free fatty acids by modulating the sensitivity of carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 to malonyl-CoA through direct physical interaction, leading to enhanced energy expenditure in adipocytes/adipose tissue. Here we show mitochondrial carrier homolog 2 functions as a negative regulator of energy metabolism in adipocytes and represents a potential target for treating obesity and related metabolic disorders.

This progress has spurred investment in developing new ADCs and expanding the use of approved ADCs in clinical practice. The design of ADCs is complex, involving multiple molecular components that interact with both tumour and host tissue microenvironments. In this Review, we explore the molecular and immunological factors influencing ADC efficacy and toxicity. We describe how the molecular components of ADCs determine their systemic, tissue and cellular distribution, which ultimately dictates therapeutic efficacy. These interactions also determine the toxicity profile and set limitations on maximum dosing. Finally, we discuss the impact of ADC treatment on immune cells, emphasizing the distinct but interconnected roles of immunogenic cell death, activation of immune cells such as dendritic cells and antibody-Fc interactions. These mechanisms are crucial for increasing efficacy beyond the direct cytotoxic effects of the payload. By providing insights into the intricate interactions of ADCs, this Review aims to inform the rational design of combination therapies and guide the development of the next generation of clinically effective ADCs.

However, specific Eomesodermin (Eomes)-dependent stages of Tr1 differentiation and function remain unclear. Using preclinical models of bone marrow transplantation (BMT), we demonstrated a Tr1 differentiation trajectory in vivo from Eomes(+)IL-10(-) to Eomes(+)IL-10(+) subsets with the acquisition of cytokine, cytolytic, and exhaustion features. The Eomes(+)CD4(+) fraction represented the dominant cytotoxic subset after BMT, mediating graft-versus-leukemia effects while limiting inflammation. In CD19-targeted chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell immunotherapy, Eomes drove the same CD4(+) Tr1 phenotype that controlled cytolysis, while mitigating immune toxicity and promoting persistence. In individuals with high-grade B cell lymphomas that had long-term disease control after receiving commercial CD19-targeted CAR T cells, Eomes(+) Tr1 cells represented a stable population comprising 40%-80% of the CD4(+) CAR T cell population. Hence, Eomes controls both regulatory and cytotoxic programs in CD4(+) T cells, essential for curative immunotherapy outcomes.	Immunity	02/10/2025

AMPs are promising candidates due to their broad-spectrum activity, rapid bactericidal mechanisms and reduced likelihood of inducing resistance compared with conventional antibiotics. Here, a pre-trained protein large language model (LLM), ProteoGPT, was established and further developed into multiple specialized subLLMs to assemble a sequential pipeline. This pipeline enables rapid screening across hundreds of millions of peptide sequences, ensuring potent antimicrobial activity and minimizing cytotoxic risks. Through transfer learning, we endowed the LLMs with different domain-specific knowledge to achieve high-throughput mining and generation of AMPs within a unified methodological framework. Notably, both mined and generated AMPs exhibited reduced susceptibility to resistance development in ICU-derived carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB) and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in vitro. The AMPs also showed comparable or superior therapeutic efficacy in in vivo thigh infection mouse models compared with clinical antibiotics, without causing organ damage and disrupting gut microbiota. The mechanisms of action of these AMPs involve disruption of the cytoplasmic membrane and membrane depolarization. Overall, this study presents a generative artificial intelligence approach for the discovery of novel antimicrobials against multidrug-resistant bacteria, enabling efficient and extensive exploration of AMP space.

10.1186/s12943-025-02459-8	Reprogramming cellular senescence and aging clocks for advanced cancer	Yang H, Liu D, Qiu L, Wang R, Zhang C, Yu D, Zhong Q, Yuki N, Song Z, Zhu T, Ju H, Hong W, Zhu J	Cellular senescence has gradually been recognized as a key process, which not only inhibits the occurrence of early tumors but also promotes advanced malignant progression through secretory and immunomodulatory functions. Initially, cellular senescence manifested as irreversible cell cycle arrest, but now it encompasses a broader phenotype regulated by the p53-p21CIP1 and p16INK4A-Rb pathways. Although secretory phenotypes related to aging can recruit immune effectors to clear new tumor cells, persistent senescent cell populations often trigger chronic inflammation, promoting immune escape and fibrosis. In this review, we first discuss the molecular underpinnings of cellular senescence, highlighting its induction pathways and diverse physiological or pathological roles. We then examine the composition of the tumor microenvironment, where senescent cells accumulate and secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines, reshaping immune surveillance and extracellular matrix architecture. Against this backdrop, we explore how aging clocks refine our understanding of individual susceptibility to malignancy by distinguishing biological from chronological aging. We also present current therapeutic prospects, including senolytic agents targeting senescent stromal cells that promote tumor growth, and the utilization of aging clock metrics to tailor immunotherapies more effectively for older patients. Finally, we consider the major challenges facing clinical translation, from standardizing multi-omics data pipelines to clarifying the ethical implications of measuring biological age. By bridging senescence biology with geroscience and cutting-edge oncology, we posit that aging clocks may catalyze a transformation in cancer care, enabling more personalized, effective, and age-conscious treatment strategies.

Human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), which are among the most transformative and safe drugs in oncology(1) and autoimmunity(2), are rarely used for infectious diseases and not yet used for antimicrobial resistance(3). Here we applied an antigen-agnostic strategy to isolate extremely potent human mAbs against Klebsiella pneumoniae sequence type 147 (ST147), a hypervirulent and pandrug-resistant lineage that is spreading globally. Isolated mAbs target the KL64 capsule and the O-antigen. However, although mAbs displayed bactericidal activity in the picomolar range in vitro, only the capsule-specific mAbs were protective against fulminant bloodstream infection by ST147 and two geographically and genetically distant carbapenem-resistant KL64-bearing K. pneumoniae. Protection observed in vivo correlated with in vitro bacterial uptake by macrophages and enchained bacterial growth. Our study thus describes a mAb that protects against pandrug-resistant K. pneumoniae and provides a strategy to isolate mAbs and identify mAbs that confer protection against bacteria with antimicrobial resistance.

If step changes are to be made in the management of knee osteoarthritis, novel patient stratification approaches are needed to identify the most effective treatment for individual patients. Numerous methods for stratifying patients with knee osteoarthritis can be employed; clinical presentation, including co-morbidity and pain phenotype, can influence treatment decisions, and there is a rich history of imaging biomarker use, both from conventional radiographs and, since its development, via MRI, in identifying patients at risk of disease progression, and the latter facilitates the detection of synovitis. The development of novel biochemical biomarkers and the rapid growth of '-omics' technologies provide fresh opportunities to deploy these advances in the stratification of patients with knee osteoarthritis. The health economic landscape in this area is developing, and scoping work has highlighted the need for further studies.	Nature reviews. Rheumatology	03/10/2025
10.1016/j.neuron.2025.09.004	Astrocyte-mediated central amygdala microcircuit gates comorbid anxiety symptoms	Zan GY, Yao SY, Deng YZ, Jiang YH, Ye RF, Chen Y, Long JD, Cheng YJ, Chai JR, Xu C, Zhao M, Liu ZQ, Liu JG, Wang YJ	Comorbid anxiety symptoms are prominent affective components of chronic pain, yet the central mechanisms underlying these symptoms remain elusive. The central amygdala (CeA) regulates nociceptive processing and associated anxiety in chronic pain. However, the specific microcircuits and cell types within the CeA that regulate pain-related anxiety have not been fully elucidated. In this study, we discovered a microcircuit in the CeA wherein dynorphinergic neurons of the lateral subdivision of the central amygdala (CeL) project to the medial subdivision (CeM), activation of which gates anxiogenic effects associated with chronic pain. Dynorphin-mediated activation of CeM astroglial kappa opioid receptors (KORs), dependent upon corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) receptor 2 signaling, enhanced CeM neuron excitability by promoting N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) activation, likely via releasing gliotransmitter D-serine. Behaviorally, KOR-mediated bidirectional communication between CeA peptidergic neurons and astrocytes modulates the anxiogenic effect of chronic pain. Our findings reveal a neuroglial microcircuit underlying pain-associated anxiety and suggest potential targets for therapeutic intervention.	Neuron	02/10/2025

Here we show that glioblastoma, the most malignant type of brain tumor, induces calvarial bone abnormalities in murine models and patients with glioblastoma, altering osteoclast activities and increasing the number of skull channels in mice. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed glioblastoma-mediated alterations in the immune landscape of skull marrow and femoral bone marrow, including expansion of neutrophils and deterioration of various B cell subsets. In vivo inhibition of bone resorption reduced bone abnormalities, but promoted tumor progression in mesenchymal subtype tumors. This also abolished the survival benefit of the checkpoint inhibitor anti-PD-L1, by reducing activated T cell and increasing inflammatory neutrophil numbers. Together, these data provide insight into how brain tumors affect skull bone and the immune environment.	Nature neuroscience	03/10/2025
10.1136/gutjnl-2025-334988	DPP-4 inhibitor alleviates gut-brain axis pathology in Parkinson's disease.	Jeong SH, Kim YJ, Shin JY, Oh KW, Lee JW, Lee PH	BACKGROUND: Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP-4is) have been reported to exhibit therapeutic effects in Parkinson's disease (PD), increasing their potential for drug repurposing. One aspect of PD pathogenesis is thought to be associated with the gut-brain axis, where α-synuclein from the gut is transmitted to the brain via the vagus nerve (VN). OBJECTIVE: We explored whether sitagliptin, a DPP-4i, exhibits a protective effect in a low-dose rotenone-treated gut-brain axis-associated PD model. DESIGN: To explore the effect of sitagliptin, we used the oral rotenone-treated mouse model, which showed spreading of pathological α-synuclein from the intestine in a stereotypic manner via the VN into the midbrain with motor deficits. RESULTS: Sitagliptin mitigated rotenone-induced gut inflammation and toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) expression, reduced α-synuclein accumulation in the gut, VN and brain and lessened neuronal loss in the medulla and midbrain with recovery of motor performance. In addition, sitagliptin suppressed inflammation in response to a TLR2 agonist and rotenone in macrophages, enteric glial cells and enteroendocrine cell lines in vitro. In secretin tumour cell 1, an enteroendocrine cell line, sitagliptin also decreased rotenone-induced endogenous α-synuclein levels. The beneficial effects of sitagliptin were maintained even under glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor blockade. Notably, sitagliptin significantly altered the gut microbiome, shifting towards a profile that may counteract PD pathology. CONCLUSION: These findings demonstrated that sitagliptin alleviated α-synuclein deposition in the gut and brain through modulation of TLR2-mediated inflammation and altered the gut microbiome composition towards a more favourable profile, which indicates that DPP-4is can offer a novel therapeutic avenue for managing PD.

10.1016/S0140-6736(25)01039-6	Effect of repurposed simvastatin on disability progression in secondary	Chataway J, Williams T, Blackstone J, John N, Braisher M, De Angelis F, Bianchi A, Calvi A, Doshi A, Apap Mangion S, Wade C, Bordea E, Merry R, Barton G, Lyle D, Jarman E, Mahad D, Shehu A, Arun T, McDonnell G, Geraldes R, Craner M, Hillier C, Ganesalingam J, Fisniku L, Hobart J, Spilker C, Robertson NP, Kalra S, Pluchino S, Harikrishnan S, Mattoscio M, Harrower T, Young C, Lee M, Chhetri SK, Ahmed F, Rog D, Silber E, Gallagher P, Duddy M, Straukiene A, Nicholas R, Rice C, Tebbs S, Hawton A, Hunter R, Giovannoni G, Ciccarelli O, Beveridge J, Nixon S, Thompson AJ, Greenwood J, Pearson OR, Evangelou N, Sharrack B, Galea I, Gray E, Pavitt S, Chandran S, Ford HL, Frost C, Nicholas JM	BACKGROUND: Despite the success of immune modulation in the treatment of relapsing multiple sclerosis, disability progression is a major problem driven by multiple mechanisms. Comorbidities (eg, vascular risk) and ageing are thought to augment these neurodegenerative pathologies. In the phase 2b MS-STAT trial of simvastatin (80 mg) versus placebo in secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS), the adjusted difference in brain atrophy rate between groups was -0·254% per year: a 43% reduction. In this phase 3 MS-STAT2 trial, we aimed to assess the efficacy of simvastatin versus placebo in slowing the progression of disability in SPMS. METHODS: This phase 3, randomised, double-blind, parallel group, placebo-controlled clinical trial was conducted at 31 neuroscience centres and district general hospitals in the UK. Participants aged 18-65 years with a diagnosis of SPMS and an Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) of between 4·0 and 6·5 were eligible and randomly assigned (1:1) to oral simvastatin (80 mg) or matched placebo for up to 4·5 years, based on a minimisation algorithm within an independent and secure online randomisation service. All participants, site investigators, and the trial coordinating team were masked to treatment allocation. The primary outcome was time to 6-month EDSS confirmed disability progression (an increase of at least 1 point if EDSS score at baseline visit was less than 6·0 or an increase of 0·5 point if EDSS score at baseline visit was 6·0 or more) assessed in all randomly assigned participants (intention-to-treat analysis) without imputation. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03387670) and is on the ISRCTN registry (ISRCTN82598726). The study is completed. FINDINGS: Between May 10, 2018, and July 26, 2024, 1079 patients were screened for eligibility and 964 participants were randomly assigned, with 482 (50%) in the placebo group and 482 (50%) in the simvastatin group. Of all 964 participants, 704 (73%) were female and 260 (27%) were male, with a mean age of 54 years (SD 7). 173 (36%) of 482 participants in the placebo group and 192 (40%) of 482 participants in the simvastatin group had 6-month confirmed disability progression (adjusted hazard ratio 1·13 [95% CI 0·91 to 1·39], p=0·26). Although no emergent safety issues were seen, there was one serious adverse reaction (rhabdomyolysis) in the simvastatin group. 12 (2%) of 482 participants in the placebo group and five (1%) of 482 participants in the simvastatin group had a cardiovascular serious adverse event. INTERPRETATION: The MS-STAT2 trial did not show a treatment effect of simvastatin in slowing disability progression in SPMS. Simvastatin use in multiple sclerosis should be confined to existing vascular indications.

The first and most common clinical manifestation is the circular, inflamed skin lesion referred to as erythema migrans; later manifestations result from infections of other body sites. Laboratory diagnosis of Lyme disease can be challenging in patients with erythema migrans because of the time delay in the development of specific diagnostic antibodies against Borrelia. Reliable blood biomarkers for the early diagnosis of Lyme disease in patients with erythema migrans are needed. Here, we performed selected reaction monitoring, a targeted mass spectrometry-based approach, to measure selected proteins that (1) are known to be predominantly expressed in one organ (i.e., organ-specific blood proteins) and whose blood concentrations may change as a result of Lyme disease, or (2) are involved in acute immune responses. In a longitudinal cohort of 40 Lyme disease patients and 20 healthy controls, we identified 10 proteins with significantly altered serum levels in patients at the time of diagnosis, and we also developed a 10-protein panel identified through multivariate analysis. In an independent cohort of patients with erythema migrans, six of these proteins, APOA4, C9, CRP, CST6, PGLYRP2, and S100A9, were confirmed to show significantly altered serum levels in patients at time of presentation. Nine of the 10 proteins from the multivariate panel were also verified in the second cohort. These proteins, primarily innate immune response proteins or proteins specific to liver, skin, or white blood cells, may serve as candidate blood biomarkers requiring further validation to aid in the laboratory diagnosis of early Lyme disease.

10.1186/s12902-025-02043-7	Efficacy and safety of variable-dose metformin as adjunctive therapy to insulin	Li C, Qiao L, Li T	BACKGROUND: Adolescent Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) is complicated by insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and heightened cardiovascular risk. As adjunctive metformin therapy lacks optimized dosing, we conducted a network meta-analysis (NMA) to rigorously assess the dose-dependent efficacy and safety of metformin combined with insulin in this population. METHODS: Totally 764 adolescents (aged 10-19 years) met inclusion criteria were involved. We assessed five metformin regimens: 1.0 g/day, 1.7 g/day, 2.0 g/day, weight-based (≤ 60 kg:1.0 g/day;≥60 kg:2.0 g/day), and multi-tiered weight-based (< 50 kg:1.0 g;50-75 kg:1.5 g;≥75 kg:2.0 g). Outcomes included HbA1c, BMI/BMI-Z, insulin dose, lipid profile, and adverse events. A Bayesian NMA was performed using R 4.4.1, with effect sizes reported as mean differences (MD) or relative risks (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) values ranked interventions. RESULTS: Consequently, metformin 2.0 g/day significantly reduced BMI (MD=-0.6 kg/m², 95%CI:-0.68, -0.52) and LDL-C (MD=-12.78 mg/dL, 95%CI:-21.17, -0.49) versus placebo. Doses of 1.0 g/day, 2.0 g/day, and the 60 kg weight-based regimen significantly reduced daily insulin requirements. Metformin 2.0 g/day and the 50 kg weight-based regimen reduced total cholesterol. No regimen significantly lowered HbA1c or triglycerides versus placebo. All doses demonstrated safety profiles comparable to placebo regarding gastrointestinal events, hypoglycemia, diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), and transaminase elevations (RRs not significant). CONCLUSION: To sum up, adjunctive metformin at 2.0 g/day offers significant benefits in weight management, insulin dose reduction, and lipid improvement (LDL-C, total cholesterol) for adolescents with T1D, with a favorable safety profile across all doses, which will represent a viable therapeutic option.

10.1186/s12916-025-04365-8	Changes in accelerated aging and risk of cardiovascular disease and mortality:	Zhang JJ, Yu HC, Geng TT, Chen SH, Wang YX, Guo H, Zhang XM, He MA, Gao JL, Liu G, Liao YF, Wu SL, Pan A	BACKGROUND: Accelerated aging is a dynamic process, yet few studies examined the association of changes in accelerated aging with cardiovascular disease (CVD) and mortality. This study aims to evaluate this association in three prospective cohorts from China and the UK. METHODS: Data were drawn from the Kailuan cohort (n = 107,830), the Dongfeng-Tongji (DFTJ) cohort (n = 14,032), and the UK Biobank (n = 316,087). Accelerated aging was assessed by PhenoAge and Klemera-Doubal method (KDM) age, measured at baseline (Kailuan cohort: 2006-2009; DFTJ cohort: 2008-2010; UK Biobank: 2006-2010) and the first follow-up (Kailuan cohort: 2010-2013; DFTJ cohort: 2013; UK Biobank: 2012-2013). Changes in accelerated aging were classified as persistent accelerated aging, recovery from accelerated aging, delayed accelerated aging, and stable non-accelerated aging. Cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Meta-analysis was performed to summarize estimates across three cohorts. RESULTS: Median follow-up periods were 10.3-15.9 years across three cohorts. When defining accelerated aging by PhenoAge, baseline accelerated aging was significantly associated with increased risks of CVD (pooled HR: 1.41, 95% CI: 1.25, 1.60) and mortality (pooled HR: 1.47, 95% CI: 1.33, 1.63). Compared to participants with persistent accelerated aging, participants recovering from accelerated aging (pooled HR of CVD: 0.76, 95% CI: 0.72, 0.81; pooled HR of mortality: 0.84, 95% CI: 0.78, 0.89), delaying accelerated aging (pooled HR of CVD: 0.75, 95% CI: 0.70, 0.79; pooled HR of mortality: 0.77, 95% CI: 0.72, 0.83) or maintaining non-accelerated aging (pooled HR of CVD: 0.59, 95% CI: 0.48, 0.71; pooled HR of mortality: 0.58, 95% CI: 0.55, 0.62) exhibited decreased risks of both CVD and mortality. When defining accelerated aging by KDM age, the results remained consistent with those of PhenoAge. CONCLUSIONS: Accelerated aging is a significant risk factor for CVD and mortality. Recovering from or delaying accelerated aging, or maintaining non-accelerated aging, was associated with reduced risks of CVD and mortality.	BMC medicine	03/10/2025
10.1126/science.ady2167	Engineered geminivirus replicons enable rapid in planta directed evolution.	Zhu H, Qin X, Wei L, Jiang D, Zhang Q, Wang W, Liang R, Zhang R, Zhang K, Liu G, Zhao KT, Chen K, Qiu JL, Gao C	Directed evolution can rapidly generate genetic variants with new and enhanced properties, yet efficient platforms for performing such evolution directly in plant cells have been lacking. We developed Geminivirus Replicon-Assisted in Planta Directed Evolution (GRAPE), a system that links gene function to geminivirus rolling circle replication (RCR) to enable high-throughput selection for desired activities. GRAPE supports the screening of up to 10(5) variants on a single Nicotiana benthamiana leaf within four days. Using GRAPE, we evolved the immune receptor NRC3 to resist inhibition by the nematode effector SPRYSEC15 and broadened the recognition spectrum of the rice immune receptor Pikm-1 to recognize all six alleles of the fungal effector AVR-Pik. GRAPE provides a rapid, scalable, and generalizable platform for directed evolution of diverse genes in plant cellular context.	Science (New York, N.Y.)	02/10/2025
10.1038/s41586-025-09542-6	Polygenic and developmental profiles of autism differ by age at diagnosis.	Zhang X, Grove J, Gu Y, Buus CK, Nielsen LK, Neufeld SAS, Koko M, Malawsky DS, Wade EM, Verhoef E, Gui A, Hegemann L, Geschwind DH, Wray NR, Havdahl A, Ronald A, St Pourcain B, Robinson EB, Bourgeron T, Baron-Cohen S, Børglum AD, Martin HC, Warrier V	Although autism has historically been conceptualized as a condition that emerges in early childhood(1,2), many autistic people are diagnosed later in life(3-5). It is unknown whether earlier- and later-diagnosed autism have different developmental trajectories and genetic profiles. Using longitudinal data from four independent birth cohorts, we demonstrate that two different socioemotional and behavioural trajectories are associated with age at diagnosis. In independent cohorts of autistic individuals, common genetic variants account for approximately 11% of the variance in age at autism diagnosis, similar to the contribution of individual sociodemographic and clinical factors, which typically explain less than 15% of this variance. We further demonstrate that the polygenic architecture of autism can be broken down into two modestly genetically correlated (r(g) = 0.38, s.e. = 0.07) autism polygenic factors. One of these factors is associated with earlier autism diagnosis and lower social and communication abilities in early childhood, but is only moderately genetically correlated with attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and mental-health conditions. Conversely, the second factor is associated with later autism diagnosis and increased socioemotional and behavioural difficulties in adolescence, and has moderate to high positive genetic correlations with ADHD and mental-health conditions. These findings indicate that earlier- and later-diagnosed autism have different developmental trajectories and genetic profiles. Our findings have important implications for how we conceptualize autism and provide a model to explain some of the diversity found in autism.	Nature	01/10/2025
10.1038/s41577-025-01221-x	Regulators of CD8(+) T cell exhaustion.	Sun Q, Dong C	T cell exhaustion is an adaptive and distinct cell fate that emerges in response to persistent antigen stimulation, primarily in chronic infections and cancer. It is characterized by a progressive loss of effector functions and sustained expression of multiple inhibitory receptors. Progression to T cell exhaustion is driven by persistent antigen stimulation through the T cell receptor and is modulated by signals from co-stimulatory and inhibitory molecules as well as by microenvironmental factors such as cytokines, metabolites and neuronal factors. These extrinsic cellular factors reshape the T cell transcriptome, epigenome and metabolism towards a state of exhaustion through critical intrinsic cell regulators. In this Review, we summarize our current understanding of the regulators involved in T cell exhaustion, highlighting their roles in directing the fates and functionalities of distinct exhausted T cell subsets and how they may be harnessed for the development of improved immunotherapies against cancer and chronic infections.

10.1016/j.anai.2025.09.014	Basic Mechanisms of Itch and Advances in Clinical Management.	Coscarella G, Edwards E, Yosipovitch G	Chronic pruritus requires comprehensive assessment and management due to its profound impact on quality of life. The etiologies of pruritus are diverse, encompassing dermatologic, neuropathic, systemic, psychogenic, and mixed causes. Pruritogens activate C and Aδ fibers through histaminergic and non-histaminergic pathways. Increasing evidence highlights the role of Th2 cytokines, particularly interleukin (IL)-4, IL-13, and IL-31, which directly stimulate sensory neurons and perpetuate the itch-scratch cycle. Itch perception arises from dynamic interactions between the immune system and the peripheral and central nervous systems. Signals transmitted by sensory fibers are processed in the dorsal horn and relayed to thalamic and cortical centers, reinforcing chronicity. Diagnostic evaluation begins with detailed history and examination, complemented by laboratory testing such as complete blood count, kidney, liver, glucose, and thyroid function tests to uncover systemic or neurologic contributors. For dermatologic conditions, topical immunomodulators-including corticosteroids, calcineurin inhibitors, and PDE4 inhibitors- are first-line options for localized itch. Extensive itch may require systemic immunosuppressants or phototherapy. Biologic agents targeting IL-4/IL-13 and IL-31 pathways have revolutionized treatment for atopic dermatitis and prurigo nodularis, while JAK-STAT inhibitors also offer significant antipruritic effect in atopic dermatitis and beyond. Neuropathic itch may respond to topical anesthetics: menthol, pramoxine, capsaicin, or compounded ketamine-amitriptyline-lidocaine formulations, as well as systemic gabapentinoids and antidepressants. Systemic or intractable pruritus may benefit from kappa opioid receptor agonists. New drugs targeting the mast cell such as BTK inhibitors, c-KIT inhibitors, and MRGPRX2 antagonists have robust anti-pruritic effects in mast cell-mediated diseases. Supportive measures, including psychosocial interventions, remain integral to long-term management.	Annals of allergy, asthma & immunology : official publication of the American	02/10/2025
10.1007/s11033-025-11081-2	Unraveling the multifactorial pathophysiology of polycystic ovary syndrome:	Senthilkumar H, Chauhan SC, Arumugam M	Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a complex, multifactorial metabolic and endocrine disorder in reproductive-age women. This review discusses the interlinked roles of lifestyle, metabolic dysregulation, insulin resistance, neuroendocrine impairment, genetic predisposition, and post-translational modifications (PTMs) in PCOS pathogenesis. Lifestyle components, especially those leading to obesity and insulin resistance, worsen the hyperandrogenism, ovulatory dysfunction, and inflammation. Dietary treatments such as, DASH diet and caloric restriction, particularly along with metformin, have been proven to improve metabolic and reproductive parameters. Environmental toxins, such as endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) and advanced glycation end-products (AGEs), further compromise ovarian function and hormone regulation. Oxidative stress and insulin resistance, driven by mitochondrial malfunction and chronic inflammation, create a self-perpetuating vicious cycle that compromises oocyte quality and worsens metabolic imbalance. Neuroendocrine disruption, characterized by increased GnRH and LH pulsatility, is initiated by dysregulated kisspeptin, dynorphin, and neurokinin B signaling in KNDy neurons, modified GABAergic input, and increased AMH and androgens. PTMs such as phosphorylation, methylation, acetylation, and ubiquitination also play essential roles in granulosa cell function, AR signaling, insulin sensitivity, and oocyte maturation. Current and novel treatment options vary from lifestyle modifications and pharmacological interventions (e.g., metformin, GLP-1 receptor agonists, myoinositol, vitamin D, and statins) to regenerative measures like mesenchymal stem cells and fecal microbiota transplantation. Newer therapies focusing on PTMs and neuroendocrine regulators remain the future hope. Multidisciplinary individualized management is critical for successful PCOS therapy and averting long-term complications.	Molecular biology reports	04/10/2025

Here, we aimed to identify the potential mechanism by which cysteine and glycine-rich protein 2 (CSRP2) regulates the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and participates in the resistance to lenvatinib. METHODS: We harnessed RNA sequencing, multiplex immunofluorescence staining, and hydrodynamic tail vein (HTV) injection HCC model to systematically explore the function of CSRP2 in HCC progression. To precisely delineate how immunosuppressive macrophages, influenced by CSRP2-regulated C-C motif chemokine ligand 28 (CCL28) signaling, respond to lenvatinib-induced cytotoxicity, we established an in vitro co-culture system and conducted functional cytotoxicity assays. RESULTS: Using RNA sequencing, multiplex immunofluorescence staining and HTV injection HCC mouse model, we identified CSRP2 as one of the most significantly upregulated genes in HCC tissues. CSRP2 overexpression drives anti-lenvatinib resistance by inducing high levels of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) infiltration and reshaping an immunosuppressive microenvironment. Then flow cytometry, mass spectrometry and chromatin immunoprecipitation were conducted to clarify the underlying mechanism of CSRP2. We showed CSRP2 promotes phosphorylation of activating transcription factor 2 (ATF2) at Thr69/71, leading to the transcriptional activation of CCL28 expression. HCC-derived CCL28 recruits TAMs to drive immunosuppression and anti-lenvatinib tolerance. BI6901, a potent and selective CCR10 antagonist, blocked TAMs recruitment and enhanced T-cell activation. Combining CCR10 inhibition improved the therapeutic benefit of anti-lenvatinib in HCC. CONCLUSIONS: These results illustrate that CSRP2 regulates the tumor microenvironment to promote HCC growth and drive lenvatinib tolerance via the CSRP2/ATF2/CCL28 axis. Targeting this pathway could synergize with lenvatinib to treat HCC more effectively.	Journal for immunotherapy of cancer	02/10/2025
10.3171/2025.5.JNS25786	Impact of GLP-1 receptor agonists on stroke, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and	Costa M, O'Leary S, Price AM, Young CC, Srinivasan VM, Kan P	OBJECTIVE: The authors evaluated whether glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1-RAs) improve outcomes in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH), spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (sICH), and acute ischemic stroke (AIS) and reduce the overall incidence of these events. METHODS: This retrospective study leveraged TriNetX data (2014-2024) to identify patients with aSAH, sICH, or AIS. Individuals receiving exenatide, lixisenatide, semaglutide, dulaglutide, liraglutide, or tirzepatide within 8 weeks of diagnosis were propensity matched to controls. Outcomes (e.g., mortality, rebleeding/recurrence, seizures, hydrocephalus) were assessed at 6 and 12 months; the incidence rates of stroke types were examined at 1 and 2 years. RESULTS: For aSAH patients, GLP-1-RA use at 6 months reduced rebleeding (OR 0.73, p = 0.003) and mortality (OR 0.41, p < 0.001) and at 1 year lowered cognitive deficits (OR 0.63, p = 0.034) and mortality (OR 0.39, p < 0.001). In sICH patients, GLP-1-RAs decreased hydrocephalus (OR 0.37, p = 0.005) and seizures (OR 0.56, p = 0.007) at 6 months, with persistent benefits at 1 year (hydrocephalus, OR 0.38, p = 0.007; seizures, OR 0.63, p = 0.018), alongside lower mortality (OR 0.45-0.40, both p < 0.001) and rebleeding (OR 0.70-0.69, both p < 0.001) rates. In AIS patients, mortality fell at 6 months (OR 0.27, p < 0.001) and 1 year (OR 0.44, p < 0.001), with reduced recurrence (OR 0.60, p < 0.001) and lower hydrocephalus (OR 0.32, p < 0.001) and seizure (OR 0.43, p < 0.001) rates at 6 months. At 1 year, GLP-1-RA users had lower incidence rates of SAH (OR 0.64, p = 0.001), ICH (OR 0.62, p < 0.001), and AIS (OR 0.82, p = 0.003), which were sustained at 2 years (ORs 0.77-0.87, all p < 0.05). Adverse events were similar. CONCLUSIONS: GLP-1-RAs were associated with improved survival and fewer complications across stroke subtypes, plus reduced hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke incidence. Prospective trials are warranted to confirm these observations.	Journal of neurosurgery	03/10/2025

Current recipient-centric desensitization protocols involving antibody depletion through plasmapheresis increase the risk of infections, perioperative bleeding events and costs. Here we present a donor-centric desensitization protocol, converting type-A kidneys into enzyme-converted O kidneys during hypothermic perfusion to remove the A antigen from the kidneys. An ex vivo model resulted in no antibody-mediated injury. Encouraged by this, an enzyme-converted O kidney was transplanted into a type-O brain-dead recipient with a high titre of anti-A antibody, and no hyperacute rejection was observed. The graft was well tolerated with no evidence of antibody-mediated rejection for 2 days. Antibody-mediated lesions and complement deposition were found starting 3 days post-transplant, coinciding with A-antigen regeneration, and later higher Banff scores, suggesting an immune-mediated response. Single-cell sequencing confirms the elevated expression of accommodation-related genes, suggesting the potential for longer-term tolerance.

10.1212/WNL.0000000000213904	Longitudinal Association of a Polygenic Risk Score for Plasma T-Tau With Incident	Mourtzi N, Charisis S, Ntanasi E, Hatzimanolis A, Ramirez A, Sampatakakis SN, Yannakoulia M, Kosmidis MH, Dardiotis E, Hadjigeorgiou G, Sakka P, Mamalaki E, Papandreou C, Georgakis MK, Scarmeas N	BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Elevated levels of total tau (t-tau) are a key biomarker of neurodegeneration, often seen in Alzheimer disease (AD). Identifying individuals at increased risk of AD using minimally invasive biomarkers can enable early intervention. We developed a polygenic risk score (PRS) for plasma t-tau and examined its association with the risk for developing clinical endophenotypes of AD pathology. METHODS: This longitudinal cohort study used data from the Hellenic Longitudinal Investigation of Aging and Diet (HELIAD) study, involving individuals aged 65 years or older, free of AD, or amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI-an AD prodrome) at baseline. Our primary exposure was PRStau, a PRS based on common genetic variants linked to plasma tau levels. The primary outcome was aMCI or AD incidence. We assessed the association between PRStau levels and aMCI/AD risk using Cox regression models adjusted for age, sex, education, APOE ε4 allele carriership, and population structure. We sought replication in a sample of UK Biobank (UKB) participants aged 60 years or older without prevalent dementia. RESULTS: In the HELIAD sample, among 618 cognitively healthy participants (mean age 73.37 years, 58.4% female), followed for 2.92 ± 0.80 years, 73 developed AD/aMCI. A 1 SD increase in PRStau was linked to a 29% higher AD/aMCI risk (hazard ratio [HR] 1.290, 95% CI 1.006-1.654). Stratified analyses revealed greater effect estimates in women (HR 1.451, 95% CI 1.023-2.058) and younger participants (HR 1.866, 95% CI 1.175-2.962), whereas results in men and older participants did not reach statistical significance. In the UKB sample (n = 142,637, mean age 64.2 years, 52% female), 2,737 participants developed AD over 12.9 ± 2.4 years of follow-up. Higher PRStau was also linked to increased AD risk (HR 1.046, 95% CI 1.007-1.086). DISCUSSION: These results support the potential utility of PRS for plasma t-tau in predicting AD/aMCI incidence. The relationship between genetic predisposition for elevated plasma t-tau levels and AD pathology might be influenced by sex and age, suggesting that these factors should be considered in AD genetic risk modeling. PRS could serve as an early indicator of genetic propensity for tau pathology, enhancing existing AD diagnostic and risk stratification algorithms.	Neurology	11/11/2025
10.1038/s41586-025-09589-5	Dietary cysteine enhances intestinal stemness via CD8(+) T cell-derived IL-22.	Chi F, Zhang Q, Shay JES, Han S, Ten Hoeve J, Yuan Y, Yang Z, Shin H, Block S, Solanki S, Shah YM, Vander Heiden MG, Agudo J, Yilmaz ÖH	A fundamental question in physiology is understanding how tissues adapt and alter their cellular composition in response to dietary cues(1-8). The mammalian small intestine is maintained by rapidly renewing LGR5(+) intestinal stem cells (ISCs) that respond to macronutrient changes such as fasting regimens and obesogenic diets, yet how specific amino acids control ISC function during homeostasis and injury remains unclear. Here we demonstrate that dietary cysteine, a semi-essential amino acid, enhances ISC-mediated intestinal regeneration following injury. Cysteine contributes to coenzyme A (CoA) biosynthesis in intestinal epithelial cells, which promotes expansion of intraepithelial CD8αβ(+) T cells and their production of interleukin-22 (IL-22). This enhanced IL-22 signalling directly augments ISC reparative capacity after injury. The mechanistic involvement of the pathway in driving the effects of cysteine is demonstrated by several findings: CoA supplementation recapitulates cysteine effects, epithelial-specific loss of the cystine transporter SLC7A11 blocks the response, and mice with CD8αβ(+) T cells lacking IL-22 or a depletion of CD8αβ(+) T cells fail to show enhanced regeneration despite cysteine treatment. These findings highlight how coupled cysteine metabolism between ISCs and CD8(+) T cells augments intestinal stemness, providing a dietary approach that exploits ISC and immune cell crosstalk for ameliorating intestinal damage.

Though often studied individually, it has long been recognized that the modifications function by combinatorial synergy or antagonism. Interplay may involve PTMs on the same histone, within the same nucleosome (containing a histone octamer), or between nucleosomes in higher-order chromatin. Given this, the field must distinguish ever greater complexity, and the context in which it is studied, with brevity and precision. The proteoform was introduced to define individual forms of a protein by sequence and PTMs, followed by the nucleoform to describe the particular gathering of histones within an individual nucleosome. There is now a need to define specific forms of these entities in prose while providing space for experimental nuance. To this end, we introduce a nomenclature that can express discrete PTMs, proteoforms, nucleoforms, or situations where defined PTMs exist in an uncertain context. Though specifically designed for the chromatin field, adaptions of the framework could be used to describe-and thus dissect-how proteoforms are configured in functionally distinct complexes across biology.

10.1038/s41392-025-02426-1	Rapid amyloid-β clearance and cognitive recovery through multivalent modulation	Chen J, Xiang P, Duro-Castano A, Cai H, Guo B, Liu X, Yu Y, Lui S, Luo K, Ke B, Ruiz-Pérez L, Gong Q, Tian X, Battaglia G	The blood‒brain barrier (BBB) is a highly selective permeability barrier that safeguards the central nervous system (CNS) from potentially harmful substances while regulating the transport of essential molecules. Its dysfunction is increasingly recognized as a pivotal factor in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), contributing to the accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques. We present a novel therapeutic strategy that targets low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) on the BBB. Our design leverages the multivalent nature and precise size of LRP1-targeted polymersomes to modulate receptor-mediated transport, biasing LRP1 trafficking toward transcytosis and thereby upregulating its expression to promote efficient Aβ removal. In AD model mice, this intervention significantly reduced brain Aβ levels by nearly 45% and increased plasma Aβ levels by 8-fold within 2 h, as measured by ELISA. Multiple imaging techniques confirmed the reduction in brain Aβ signals after treatment. Cognitive assessments revealed that treated AD mice exhibited significant improvements in spatial learning and memory, with performance levels comparable to those of wild-type mice. These cognitive benefits persisted for up to 6 months post-treatment. This work pioneers a new paradigm in drug design, where function arises from the supramolecular nature of the nanomedicine, harnessing multivalency to elicit biological action at the membrane trafficking level. Our findings also reaffirm the critical role of the BBB in AD pathogenesis and demonstrate that targeting the BBB can make therapeutic interventions significantly more effective. We establish a compelling case for BBB modulation and LRP1-mediated Aβ clearance as a transformative foundation for future AD therapies.	Signal transduction and targeted therapy	07/10/2025

Here, we investigated the efficacy and safety of glecirasib in patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and other solid tumors (excluding NSCLC and CRC) that rarely harbor the KRAS G12C mutation but for which effective treatment options remain limited. METHODS: We conducted and analyzed two open-label, phase I/II trials in adult patients with KRAS G12C mutant solid tumors, in which glecirasib was administered orally. The two trials had similar eligibility criteria and endpoints but differed in the regions of patient recruitment. We performed a pooled analysis of all patients, excluding NSCLC and CRC, from both trials. The primary endpoint in the pooled population was objective response rate (ORR). Efficacy and safety were assessed in patients who received at least one dose of glecirasib. RESULTS: As of June 30, 2024, the pooled analysis included 54 patients who were treated with glecirasib: 32 PDACs, 8 biliary tract cancers (BTCs), 4 small intestinal cancers, 3 gastric cancers, 2 appendiceal cancers, and 5 other tumors. At baseline, 24 received ≥ two prior lines of systemic therapy. Of the 53 efficacy-evaluable patients, the confirmed ORR was 50.9% (95% confidence interval [CI], 36.8%-64.9%), with an ORR of 46.9% (95% CI, 29.1%-65.3%) in PDAC patients. Among other solid tumors, ORR was 71.4% (5/7) in BTC, 100% (4/4) in small intestinal cancer, and 66.7% (2/3) in gastric cancer. Median progression-free survival and median overall survival were 6.9 and 10.8 months, respectively, in the overall population, and 5.5 and 10.8 months, respectively, in patients with PDAC. Treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) of any grade occurred in 94.4% patients, with grade ≥ 3 TRAEs in 27.8%. No fatal TRAEs or TRAEs leading to treatment discontinuation occurred. CONCLUSIONS: Glecirasib showed promising efficacy and was well tolerated in patients with PDAC and other advanced solid tumors (beyond NSCLC and CRC), warranting further expedited clinical development in this patient population.

10.1126/science.ads8728	GCN1 couples GCN2 to ribosomal state to initiate amino acid response pathway	Zhou C, Zhang M, Murray J, Paulo J, Gygi S, Shao S, Whitman M, Keller T	During nutrient deprivation, activation of the protein kinase GCN2 regulates cell survival and metabolic homeostasis. In addition to amino acid stress, GCN2 is activated by a variety of cellular stresses. GCN2 activation has been linked to its association with uncharged tRNAs, specific ribosomal proteins, and conditions of translational arrest, but their relative contribution to activation is unclear. Here, we used in vitro translation to reconstitute GCN2 activation by amino acid stress and compared collided ribosome populations induced by diverse translational stressors. Initiation of GCN2 signaling required the di-ribosome sensor GCN1, which recruits GCN2 to ribosomes in a collision-dependent manner, where GCN2 becomes activated by key ribosomal interactions and stably associated with collided ribosomes. Our findings define the molecular requirements and dynamics of GCN2 activation.	Science (New York, N.Y.)	02/10/2025

We identified up-regulated S-nitrosoglutathione reductase (GSNOR) as a critical factor associated with diabetic vascular complications by unbiased proteomics. Elevated GSNOR expression was observed in the endothelium of patients with type 2 diabetes and in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced type 1 diabetes mice as well as in db/db type 2 diabetes mouse models. Genetic ablation of endothelial Gsnor promoted angiogenesis, maintained vascular permeability, and improved vasodilation in type 1 diabetes mice induced by STZ.

This phase 2 trial (ChiCTR2100049829) evaluated the feasibility and safety of TACE combined with atezolizumab and bevacizumab in patients with intermediate-stage HCC. Participants received TACE followed by atezolizumab and bevacizumab until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or death. The primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR) assessed per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1. Secondary endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), ORR by modified RECIST (mRECIST), disease control rate (DCR), time to response (TTR), duration of response (DOR), and adverse events (AEs). Between August 21, 2021 and April 10, 2023, 45 patients were enrolled. As of the data cutoff on September 30, 2024, the median follow-up was 26.7 months. The ORR was 47% per RECIST v1.1 and 67% per mRECIST. Median PFS was 17.9 months, and median OS was 33.0 months. The DCR was 87% (RECIST v1.1) and 91% (mRECIST). Median TTR was 11.9 weeks (RECIST v1.1) and 4.9 weeks (mRECIST), with median DOR of 36.6 weeks (RECIST v1.1) and 44.4 weeks (mRECIST). Of the 45 patients, 44 experienced AEs of any grade, with 20 reporting grade 3-4 AEs; no grade 5 AEs were observed. TACE combined with atezolizumab and bevacizumab appears safe and feasible for intermediate-stage HCC, supporting further investigation in larger studies.

In the randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind phase 3 ENLIGHT UC study, also known as the ES101002 study, we aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of etrasimod in patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis in East Asia. METHODS: Using a central interactive web response system, in the 12-week induction period, adults (aged 18-75 years, inclusive) with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis (modified Mayo score [MMS] 4-9 with an endoscopic subscore ≥2 and a rectal bleeding subscore ≥1) and an inadequate response, loss of response, or intolerance to at least one ulcerative colitis treatment were randomly assigned (2:1) to once-daily oral etrasimod 2 mg or placebo. Patients and study staff were masked to treatment assignment. Patients were enrolled from 52 hospitals across China, Taiwan, and Souh Korea. Randomisation was stratified by previous treatment status and baseline disease activity. Patients who had an MMS clinical response at induction period week 12 were re-randomly assigned (1:1) to once-daily oral etrasimod 2 mg or placebo for the 40-week maintenance period. Randomisation was stratified by induction period treatment, previous exposure to biologicals or JAK inhibitors, and concomitant use of oral corticosteroids at induction period baseline. The primary efficacy outcome was MMS clinical remission (stool frequency subscore=0 [or stool frequency subscore=1 with a ≥1 point decrease from induction period baseline], rectal bleeding subscore=0, and endoscopic subscore ≤1 [excluding friability]), assessed in the induction and maintenance periods separately (at induction period week 12 and maintenance period week 40). The primary efficacy analyses used the full analysis set (FAS), which included all patients who were randomly assigned and received at least one dose of study treatment for the induction period, and all re-randomly assigned patients who showed clinical response at induction period week 12 and received at least one dose of study treatment for the maintenance period. The safety analyses for each treatment period used the safety analysis set (SAF), which included all patients who received any amount of study drug in the corresponding treatment period. ENLIGHT UC is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04176588) and the study is complete. FINDINGS: 606 patients were screened between Sept 25, 2019, and April 27, 2023, and 340 were randomly assigned for the induction period and treated (FAS: 228 patients [88 female and 140 male] assigned to etrasimod and 112 patients [44 female and 68 male] assigned to placebo). 157 patients who showed clinical response in the induction period were re-randomly assigned and treated in the maintenance period (FAS: 77 patients [35 female and 42 male] assigned to etrasimod and 80 patients [32 female and 48 male] assigned to placebo). A significantly greater proportion of patients treated with etrasimod than those treated with placebo, showed clinical remission at induction week 12 (57 [25·0%] of 228 patients vs six [5·4%] of 112 patients; adjusted difference 20·4%; 95% CI 13·4%-27·4%; p<0·0001) and maintenance period week 40 (37 [48·1%] of 77 patients vs 10 [12·5%] of 80 patients; adjusted difference 35·9%; 95% CI 22·5%-49·2%; p<0·0001). In the induction period, the most frequently reported treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) was increased ALT (22 [10%] in the etrasimod group vs one [1%] in the placebo group). In the maintenance period, the most frequently reported TEAE was upper respiratory tract infection (14 [18%] in the etrasimod group vs 14 [17%] in the placebo group). Across the induction and maintenance periods, most TEAEs were mild to moderate in severity. Five (2%) of 228 patients treated with etrasimod and four (4%) of 112 patients treated with placebo discontinued study treatment due to TEAEs during the induction period, and one (1%) of 77 patients treated with etrasimod and one (1%) of 81 patients treated with placebo discontinued study treatment due to TEAEs during the maintenance period. No grade 4 or higher TEAE, malignancies, or deaths were reported. INTERPRETATION: Etrasimod was effective and well tolerated as an oral induction and maintenance treatment in patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis in East Asia.

The lysine acetyltransferases p300 and CREB-binding protein (CBP) are key cofactors that activate enhancers through histone acetylation. Here we identify p300/CBP-mediated multisite histone H2B N-terminal acetylation (H2BNTac) as a defining feature of oncogenic enhanceosomes in androgen receptor (AR)-positive prostate cancer. p300/CBP are essential for AR and ETS transcription factor ERG transcriptional activity, and their dual degradation eliminates H2BNTac and histone H3 lysine 27 acetylation at hyperactive enhancers, leading to stronger suppression of oncogenic transcription than targeting either paralog or bromodomain alone. Cytotoxicity profiling across >900 cell lines revealed that tumors with high H2BNTac, including AR-positive prostate cancer, are selectively dependent on p300/CBP. In preclinical models, systemic p300/CBP degradation inhibited tumor growth, synergized with AR antagonists and showed no evident toxicity. These findings position H2BNTac as an epigenetic marker of enhancer addiction and establish dual p300/CBP degradation as a promising therapeutic strategy for enhancer-driven cancers.

10.1126/sciimmunol.ads0449	The immunology of brain tumors.	Bunse L, Bunse T, Kilian M, Quintana FJ, Platten M	Brain tumors represent a unique challenge for cancer immunotherapies because of their location in an immune privileged site. However, the brain tumor immune microenvironment is dictated more by tumor type than the location within the brain per se. This feature is reflected by the higher immunogenicity and response to immunotherapies of metastatic brain tumors compared with primary brain tumors. Immunotherapies for brain tumors aim at inducing and boosting tumor T cell responses using vaccines, immune checkpoint inhibitors, or adoptive T cell therapies. A fundamental challenge in the field is how such brain tumor-targeting T cells gain access to brain tumors and maintain their function despite a hostile immunosuppressive microenvironment. Here, we review current knowledge of the cellular and molecular determinants of the antigenicity of brain tumors and the immunosuppressive brain tumor microenvironment. Expanding and exploiting this knowledge will provide the key for effective combinatorial therapies.	Science immunology	03/10/2025

To promote a better understanding of this disabling condition and to foster research on the topic, this review provides a comprehensive description of the hallmarks of CH, including its clinical presentation, diagnostic challenges, pathophysiology, and current and novel therapeutic targets. It concludes by describing the disease burden and advocating for significant improvements in healthcare systems, and promoting health equity, as well as reducing stigma. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Despite its distinctive clinical and chronobiological features, CH may be mistaken for other primary headache disorders or different types of orofacial pain. Key pathogenic characteristics include the activation of the trigeminal-autonomic system with the release of several neuropeptides, the involvement of the hypothalamus in regulating the circadian rhythm, genetic variants, and the mesolimbic system. Both invasive and non-invasive neuromodulation treatments have been used to target the trigemino-cervical, parasympathetic, and hypothalamic systems. Additionally, novel therapeutic targets are currently being study. Alongside canonical therapies, several complementary approaches have been explored over the years, with most evidence deriving from uncontrolled research involving individuals who do not respond to standard pharmacological treatments. Despite advancements in our understanding of this complex disease, CH continues to pose considerable social, economic, and psychological challenges. Advocacy is essential and should prioritize early diagnosis, alleviate stigma, provide specialized training for healthcare professionals, and offer support to and through patient associations. CONCLUSIONS: CH is characterised by a complex, multifactorial, pathophysiology that is still not fully understood. Precise diagnosis, additional research studies, and robust psychosocial and institutional support are necessary to improve the quality of life for individuals affected by this debilitating condition.

Swandayani YM, Cayami FK, Winarni TI, Utari A	BACKGROUND: There is a lack of genetic knowledge among health care professionals especially in some developing countries such as Indonesia. Based on our experience, genetic disorders receive less attention in medical education and professionals. This study aims to determine the familiarity and literacy of genetics among medical students in Indonesia. METHODS: A total of 1003 Indonesian medical (pre-clinical and clinical) students completed the Rapid Estimate of Adult Literacy in Genetics (REAL-G) questionnaire with a total score of seven for familiarity and eight for genetic literacy. The Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare the familiarity and genetic literacy scores between pre-clinical and clinical students. RESULTS: The average scores of familiarity and genetic literacy were 5.63 ± 0.96 and 6.37 ± 0.83, respectively. Genetic familiarity was higher (p = 0.043) among clinical students than pre-clinical students, while there was no significant difference in genetic literacy (p = 0.362) between pre-clinical and clinical students. Genetic familiarity does not impact the level of genetic literacy. However, medical students' genetic literacy is influenced by demographic characteristics, such as age, sex, university type, genetic learning experience, university accreditation, and university location. CONCLUSIONS: In general, Indonesian medical students have relatively good familiarity and literacy in genetics although further study is necessary to accurately measure the genetic familiarity and literacy in medical students and general public.

Although mitophagy is one of the main pathways involved in the clearance of damaged or old mitochondria, its coordination with mitochondrial biogenesis is poorly characterized. Here, by unbiased approaches including last-generation liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry and transcriptomics, we identify the protein phosphatase PP2A-B55α/PPP2R2A as a Parkin-dependent regulator of mitochondrial number. Upon mitochondrial damage, PP2A-B55α determines the amplitude of mitophagy induction and execution by regulating both early and late mitophagy events. A few minutes after the insult, ULK1 is released from the inhibitory regulation of PP2A-B55α, whereas 2 to 4 hours later, PP2A-B55α promotes the nuclear translocation of TFEB, the master regulator of autophagy and lysosome genes, to support mitophagy execution. Moreover, PP2A-B55α controls a transcriptional program of mitochondrial biogenesis by stabilizing the Parkin substrate and PGC-1α inhibitor PARIS. PP2A-B55α targeting rescues neurodegenerative phenotypes in a fly model of Parkinson's disease, thus suggesting potential therapeutic application.	Science advances	03/10/2025

We characterized brain health using brain clocks, which capture deviations from chronological age (i.e., accelerated or delayed brain aging). We combined M/EEG functional connectivity (N = 1,240) with machine learning support vector machines, whole-brain modeling, and Neurosynth metanalyses. From this framework, we reanalyzed previously published datasets of expert and matched non-expert participants in dance, music, visual arts, and video games, along with a pre/post-learning study (N = 232). We found delayed brain age across all domains and scalable effects (expertise>learning). The higher the level of expertise and performance, the greater the delay in brain age. Age-vulnerable brain hubs showed increased connectivity linked to creativity, particularly in areas related to expertise and creative experiences. Neurosynth analysis and computational modeling revealed plasticity-driven increases in brain efficiency and biophysical coupling, in creativity-specific delayed brain aging. Findings indicate a domain‑independent link between creativity and brain health.	Nature communications	03/10/2025
10.1016/S0140-6736(25)01625-3	Anti-cytokine biologics for asthma in adults.	Israel E, Wechsler ME, Jackson DJ, Moore WC	An estimated 3-10% of patients with asthma are unable to reach full control with currently available inhaled therapies. In a large proportion of these patients, asthma can be driven in whole or in part by type 2 (T2) inflammation, which is usually initiated by an immunological response to stimulation at mucosal surfaces. The introduction of monoclonal antibodies, which target T2 inflammatory processes, provides important options for this population. In the past decade, five anticytokine biologics (ACBs) that block specific T2 inflammatory cytokines have been introduced. Three biologics, mepolizumab, reslizumab, and benralizumab, inhibit the IL-5 or IL-5 receptor pathway; dupilumab blocks IL-4 and IL-13 through its activity on the IL-4 receptor-alpha; and tezepelumab prevents activation of the thymic stromal lymphopoietin cytokine production cascade. These drugs reduce exacerbations and improve lung function and patient-reported asthma quality of life in individuals with a history of asthma exacerbations and evidence of T2 inflammation. Some also allow oral corticosteroid reduction or elimination in patients dependent on these therapies for asthma control. The effect of ACBs varies by the degree of T2 inflammation, which is most easily assessed by blood eosinophil counts and exhaled nitric oxide. The use of ACBs guided by these biomarkers and phenotypic characteristics of patients with severe asthma allows a personalised medicine approach that increases the likelihood of improvement.

Although circulating miRNAs have been linked to carcinogenesis, they have not yet been systematically investigated in relation to risk of colorectal cancer (CRC). METHODS: We used Mendelian randomization (MR) and colocalization analyses to investigate the association of genetically predicted plasma miRNA concentrations (2083 miRNAs in 710 individuals) with risk of CRC (58,221 cases and 67,694 controls). For miRNAs associated with CRC risk, we also investigated their association with circulating plasma proteins (4907 proteins in 35,559 participants), bidirectionally, using MR. We performed pathway enrichment analysis (PEA) to explore downstream molecular pathways. RESULTS: Associations of five miRNAs with CRC were found in MR and supported in colocalization analyses. Specifically, miR-146a-5p, miR-21-5p, and miR-4707-3p were positively, and miR-1908-5p and miR-6810-3p were inversely associated with CRC risk. Several protein associations were found for these miRNAs (range of proteins with P < 0.05: 78-796; 211 with FDR < 5%), and 11 pathways were identified in PEA, including regulation of Erb-B2 receptor tyrosine kinase 4 (miR-6810-3p) and insulin-like growth factor pathways (miR-1908-5p). CONCLUSIONS: Our results support a potential implication of miR-146a-5p, miR-21-5p, miR-4707-3p, miR-1908-5p, and miR-6810-3p to CRC risk. However, their downstream effects should be elucidated before they can be utilized as preventive targets.	BMC medicine	02/10/2025

In response to DNA breaks, PARP1 is the primary ADP-ribosylation writer, modifying itself (auto-modification) and other proteins to facilitate repair. However, enzymatic inhibition blocks both processes, making it difficult to dissect their distinct functional roles. Using proteomics and site-directed mutagenesis, we identified a PARP1 mutant deficient in auto-modification, yet it retains catalytic activity. This separation-of-function mutant revealed that PARP1 auto-modification slows DNA replication fork progression but is dispensable for repair factor recruitment. Instead, auto-modification promotes the timely release of PARP1 at DNA break sites and prevents the formation of replication stress. Simultaneous inhibition of FEN1 and loss of PARP1 auto-modification gives rise to synthetic lethality, implicating auto-modification in Okazaki fragment processing. Our results demonstrate that trapping of PARP at DNA breaks impedes repair factor accessibility, constituting an important dimension of	Molecular cell	02/10/2025
10.1093/inthealth/ihaf112	Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on quality of life of adults with diabetes in	Sseguya W, Bahendeka S, MacLennan S, Guntupalli AM	BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic was associated with unprecedented healthcare, economic and social disruptions that impacted persons with diabetes mellitus (PWDM). We aimed to establish how the quality of life (QoL) of persons with diabetes in rural Uganda was impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, using the pre-pandemic, pandemic and post-pandemic self-reported QoL scores. METHODS: We surveyed 410 PWDM ≥30 y of age from three rural districts in south-western Uganda. Median QoL scores were computed and variations across the three time periods were analysed using the Friedman analysis of variance and McNemar tests as appropriate. Logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with QoL. A p-value <0.05 indicated statistical significance. RESULTS: The overall median QoL scores were 67.2 (pre-pandemic), 62.4 (pandemic) and 68.8 (post-pandemic) (p<0.001). There was a 75% increase in the proportion of participants with unsatisfactory QoL during the pandemic (p<0.001). Having diabetes complications (p<0.001), chronic comorbidity (p=0.012), no formal education (p<0.003) and travelling for healthcare using non-motorised transport (<0.001) were all independently associated with post-pandemic unsatisfactory QoL. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic caused significant deterioration in QoL among rural PWDM, raising the need for policies to prioritise the consideration of their evolving needs while designing measures for future similar widespread emergencies.

Although combined anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapy may reduce ischemic risk, it also increases bleeding, and the optimal antithrombotic strategy remains uncertain. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether adding an antiplatelet agent to anticoagulant therapy influences the net clinical benefit in patients with ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack and concurrent nonvalvular atrial fibrillation and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This multicenter, open-label randomized clinical trial was conducted at 41 sites across Japan from November 2016 to March 2025. Eligible patients had an ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack within 8 to 360 days of onset, nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, and at least 1 manifestation of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (carotid or intracranial artery stenosis, noncardioembolic stroke, ischemic heart disease, or peripheral artery disease). Data were analyzed from April 16, 2024, to October 14, 2024. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomized to receive combination therapy (anticoagulant plus antiplatelet) or anticoagulant monotherapy. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was a composite of ischemic cardiovascular events and major bleeding within 2 years. Secondary outcomes included ischemic cardiovascular events; safety outcomes included major and clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding. RESULTS: In total, 316 patients were randomized to combination therapy (n = 159) or monotherapy (n = 157) (mean [SD] age, 77.2 [7.4] years; 90 female patients [28.5%]). The trial was terminated on July 18, 2023, after an interim analysis for futility. The cumulative incidence of the primary outcome was 17.8% in the combination therapy group and 19.6% in the monotherapy group (hazard ratio [HR], 0.91; 95% CI, 0.53-1.55; P = .64). Ischemic cardiovascular events occurred in 11.1% and 14.2% (HR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.39-1.48; P = .41), and major and clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding occurred in 19.5% and 8.6% (HR, 2.42; 95% CI, 1.23-4.76; P = .008) of combination therapy and monotherapy groups, respectively. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this randomized clinical trial, in patients with ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack and concurrent nonvalvular atrial fibrillation and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, adding an antiplatelet agent to anticoagulant therapy provided no net clinical benefit over anticoagulant monotherapy, with higher bleeding risk.

While circular RNAs (circRNAs) are frequently dysregulated in ESCC, their functional roles and molecular mechanisms in tumor progression remain largely unexplored. METHODS: We characterized circRNA using RT-PCR, Sanger sequencing, and fluorescent in situ hybridization. Gain- and loss-of-function studies in vitro and in vivo were performed to assess circRNA function. Molecular interactions were investigated via RNA pull-down assays coupled with mass spectrometry, electrophoretic mobility shift assays, co-immunoprecipitation, and immunoblot analysis. Clinical relevance was evaluated by RT-qPCR and immunohistochemistry in patient specimens. RESULTS: We identified circLNF, a novel circRNA derived from the long non-coding RNA FIRRE gene, which is significantly upregulated in ESCC. Functional assays demonstrated that circLNF promotes proliferative and migratory capacities in cultured cells and accelerates tumor progression and metastasis in animal models. Mechanistically, circLNF directly interacts with IGF2BP family proteins through their ""CAUC"" motifs, protecting them from TRIM25-mediated ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. Importantly, circLNF expression positively correlated with IGF2BP1 protein levels in ESCC patient tissues, underscoring the clinical relevance of the circLNF-IGF2BP axis in ESCC progression.

10.1016/j.ebiom.2025.105941	Poor sleep health is associated with older brain age: the role of systemic	Miao Y, Wang J, Li X, Guo J, Ekblom MM, Sindi S, Zhang Q, Dove A	BACKGROUND: Poor-quality sleep has been linked to increased dementia risk. We investigated the relationship between healthy sleep pattern and older brain age, and the extent to which this is mediated by systemic inflammation. METHODS: The study included 27,500 adults from the UK Biobank (mean age 54.7 y, 54.0% female). The presence of five self-reported healthy sleep characteristics (early chronotype, 7-8 h daily sleep, no insomnia, no snoring, no excessive daytime sleepiness) were summed into a healthy sleep score (0-5 pts) and used to define three sleep patterns: healthy (≥4 pts), intermediate (2-3 pts), and poor (≤1 pt). Low-grade inflammation was estimated using the INFLA-score, a composite index of inflammatory biomarkers. After a mean follow-up of 8.9 y, brain age was estimated using a machine learning model based on 1079 brain MRI phenotypes and used to calculate brain age gap (BAG; i.e., brain age minus chronological age). Data were analysed using linear regression and generalised structural equation models. FINDINGS: At baseline, 898 (3.3%) participants had poor sleep, 15,283 (55.6%) had intermediate sleep, and 11,319 (41.2%) had healthy sleep. Compared to healthy sleep, intermediate (β = 0.25 [0.11, 0.40], P = 0.010) and poor (β = 0.46 [0.05, 0.87], P < 0.001) sleep were associated with significantly higher BAG. In mediation analysis, INFLA-score mediated 6.81% and 10.42% of the associations between intermediate and poor sleep and higher BAG. INTERPRETATION: Poor sleep health may accelerate brain ageing. This may be driven by higher levels of systemic inflammation.

10.1016/j.ejvs.2025.09.045	International Expert Consensus on the Management of Acute Aortic Type B	Squizzato F, D'Oria M, Antonello M, Trimarchi S, Mani K, Holden A, Kölbel T, Haulon S, Verhoeven E, Böckler D, Resch T, Azizzadeh A, Lombardi J, Piazza M	OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to achieve an international expert consensus on managing acute type B penetrating aortic ulcers (PAUs) and intramural haematomas (IMHs). METHODS: A modified Delphi consensus process was employed to develop recommendations for the management of acute type B PAU and IMH. Surveys were sent to international experts practicing in high volume aortic centres worldwide. Statements were voted on using a four point Likert scale in a three round Delphi process. Statements achieving grade A (full agreement 75%) or B (overall agreement 80%, full disagreement < 5%) were included as expert recommendations. Consistency of responses was measured using Cohen's κ and the intraclass correlation coefficient. RESULTS: Eighty three experts were included in the final analysis: 25 statements achieved a consensus, 18 (72%) receiving a grade B strength and 7 (28%) a grade A strength. Most statements (97%) had a high consistency classified as grade I or II. The expert panel agreed on the indication for thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) for complicated IMH/PAU, defined by rupture or refractory pain/hypertension. Uncomplicated IMH/PAU should be managed conservatively and followed up with serial computed tomography imaging during the acute phase. High risk uncomplicated IMHs are identified by increased haematoma thickness, new onset or increased size of ulcer like projections, or transition to aortic dissection; high risk uncomplicated PAUs are defined by new associated haematoma, PAU width/depth increase, or total aortic diameter increase. Uncomplicated high risk IMH/PAUs may be considered for TEVAR. In performing TEVAR, a proximal sealing length > 20 mm in a site free from haematoma should be achieved, eventually extending in zone 2, with a 0 - 10% oversize. Patency of the left subclavian artery should be maintained. CONCLUSION: An agreement among international experts was achieved on assessment, management, and follow up of acute type B IMHs and PAUs, addressing areas of inconsistencies or knowledge gaps in existing guidelines.

10.1016/S1470-2045(25)00399-7	Genetic modification of the AJCC classification of papillary thyroid cancer: an	Xing M, Lin S, Mathur A, Li Y, Bendlova B, Kuklikova V, Melo M, Jesus TT, Soares P, Colombo C, Fugazzola L, Mitsutake N, Matsuse M, Sako A, Estrada-Florez AP, Carvajal-Carmona LG, Bohórquez ME, Mian C, Vianello F, O'Neill CJ, Clifton-Bligh R, Czarniecka A, Jarzab B, Jung CK, Brahma B, Ladenson PW, Park YJ	BACKGROUND: The four-stage American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging system has been used for almost 50 years for assessing the risk of multiple cancers; the AJCC classification for papillary thyroid cancer is solely based on clinical parameters, and despite updated editions its accuracy remains suboptimal. We aimed to evaluate whether the performance of the AJCC system could be improved by integrating tumour genetic statuses of BRAF and TERT genes. METHODS: This retrospective multicentre cohort study used patient medical records from 15 medical centres across ten countries for patients (of all ages) with papillary thyroid cancer who had been surgically treated with total thyroidectomy or hemithyroidectomy with or without neck dissection, followed by postoperative radioiodine ablation and appropriate thyroid-stimulating hormone level targeting. Testing for BRAF(V600E) and TERT promotor (TERTp) mutations was performed on genomic DNA isolated from surgical or cytological specimens of primary papillary thyroid cancer tumours at each centre. Data from all medical centres were pooled for aggregated analyses of the relationship between the genetic status and papillary thyroid cancer-specific mortality for each of the four classical stages of the 7th and 8th editions of the AJCC system (AJCC7E and AJCC8E). The primary endpoint was papillary thyroid cancer-specific mortality, characterised by mortality rates per 1000 person-years. FINDINGS: Using patients who were treated for papillary thyroid cancer between January 1979, to July 2023 at the 15 centres, our cohort comprised of 4746 patients (3612 [76·1%] females and 1134 [23·9%] males), with median age of 48 years (IQR 37-59; 89 [1·9%] patients aged ≤18 years). For the 4400 patients with available ethnicity data, the majority were Asian (2140 [48·6%]) and 2096 (47·6%) were White. For AJCC7E, compared with the original stages, the genetic duet of BRAF(V600E) and TERTp mutations was associated with increased mortality in all stages versus the corresponding original stages, although the HR for stage I did not reach statistical significance. Those with wildtype BRAF(V600E) and TERTp had flat survival curves for stages I-III with AJCC7E and stages I-II of AJCC8E. Patients with dual mutations had reductions in survival across all stages for the AJCC7E (stage I HR 5·96 [95% CI 0·73-48·66]; p=0·10; stage II 5·94 [95% CI 1·42-24·91]; p=0·015; stage III 4·04 [95% CI 1·87-8·70]; p=0·00037; and stage IV 1·79 [95% CI 1·15-2·76]; p=0·0092). TERTp mutation alone was also significantly associated with a significant increase in mortality for stage IV (3·57 [2·01-6·37]; p<0·0001). For AJCC8E, we observed a similar pattern of increased mortality when both mutations were present compared to mortality in the original staging, with significant differences in HR for stages I and II (stage I adjusted HR 10·30 [95% CI 3·43-30·93], p<0·0001; stage II HR 3·95 [95% CI 1·92-8·15]; p=0·00020). Stage III also showed increased mortality with dual mutations, but the increase was not statistically significant (HR 1·77 [0·95-3·31]; p=0·072). In contrast to AJCC7E, the dual mutations did not increase mortality compared with the original stage IV (HR 0·95 [0·47-1·92], p=0·89), but the TERTp mutation did significantly increase mortality in stage IV papillary thyroid cancer (HR 2·75 [1·36-5·58], p=0·0049). INTERPRETATION: Integrating the genetic statuses of BRAF and TERTp into the AJCC system changes the original risk stages of the AJCC system and significantly improves the accuracy of its mortality risk classification for papillary thyroid cancer.

10.1186/s12933-025-02932-0	Association between metabolic score for insulin resistance and future stroke risk	Wu H, Zhou Y, Lai X, Ma B, Ding L, Zhu X, Chen Z, Liu Z	BACKGROUND: Metabolic disorders, cardiovascular diseases, and chronic kidney diseases are closely interrelated, and the proposal of cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic (CKM) syndrome concept has received extensive attention.The disease burden of CKM is heavy, with stroke being a significant contributor, and CKM staging is bidirectional.A large body of evidence has demonstrated that insulin resistance is closely associated with diseases such as stroke, obesity and chronic kidney disease. While the metabolic score for insulin resistance (METS-IR) serves as an important indicator for evaluating insulin resistance, the relationship between METS-IR and stroke incidence remains unclear in the population defined by CKM syndrome stages 0-3. METHODS: In this study, data on individuals with CKM syndrome stages 0-3 without stroke at baseline were collected from China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS).Self-reported stroke was used as the primary outcome, with METS-IR at baseline as the exposure factor. Logistic regression was performed to analyze the effect of METS-IR on the incidence of stroke among participants with CKM, and restricted cubic spline (RCS) regression was utilized to explore the potential nonlinear relationship between them. To evaluate the predictive value of METS-IR for stroke risk in individuals with CKM syndrome stages 0-3, we applied receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. RESULTS: A total of 5009 participants were included in this study, with a mean age of 60.48 ± 8.81 years. Over a 5-year follow-up, 339 participants in this study developed incident stroke. Participants were stratified into METS-IR quartiles (Q1-Q4). In the fully adjusted model, compared with Q1 (the lowest quartile), the odds ratio (OR) for Q3 was 1.88 (95% CI: 1.25-2.81; P = 0.002), and the OR for Q4 was 1.72 (95% CI: 1.08-2.76; P = 0.02). RCS analysis revealed a nonlinear relationship between METS-IR and stroke risk among participants with CKM syndrome stages 0-3 (P-overall < 0.05; P-nonlinearity < 0.05). ROC analysis showed an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.726 (95% CI: 0.699-0.752), with an optimal METS-IR cutoff value of 29.58. CONCLUSIONS: In individuals with CKM syndrome stages 0-3, elevated METS-IR levels may be associated with an increased stroke risk. Furthermore, METS-IR demonstrates moderate predictive value for stroke risk in this population. Monitoring METS-IR may therefore aid in their early identification.

Here we aim to develop a comprehensive and consensus-based checklist for conducting and reporting tES studies to enhance the quality of research and reports. In this Consensus Statement, we used a Delphi approach conducted across three rounds and involving 38 experts to identify crucial elements required to report in tES studies. This consensus-driven approach included the evaluation of the interquartile deviation (>1.00), the percentage of positive responses (above 60%) and mean importance ratings (<3), hence ensuring the creation of a robust and well-balanced checklist. These metrics were utilized to assess both the consensus reached and importance ratings for each item. Consensus was reached, leading to the retention of 66 out of the initial 70 items. These items were categorized into five groups: participants (12 items), stimulation device (9 items), electrodes (12 items), current (12 items) and procedure (25 items). We then distilled a shorter version of the checklist, which includes the 26 items deemed essential. The Report Approval for Transcranial Electrical Stimulation (RATES) checklist is relevant to those carrying out and assessing tES studies, as it provides a structured framework for researchers to consider and report. For reviewers, it can serve as a tool to assess completeness, comprehensiveness and transparency of reports. In addition, the RATES checklist aims to promote a deeper understanding of tES and facilitates comparisons between studies within the field. Overall, the RATES checklist provides a shared reference point that may improve research quality, foster harmonization in reporting and, ultimately, enhance the interpretability and reproducibility of findings in both research and clinical contexts.

In this field, 'brain age gap' has emerged as a promising magnetic resonance imaging-based biomarker that quantifies the deviation between an individual's biological and chronological age of the brain. Here we conducted an in-depth genomic analysis of the brain age gap and its relationships with over 1,000 health traits. Genome-wide analyses in up to 56,348 individuals unveiled a heritability of 23-29% attributable to common genetic variants and highlighted 59 associated loci (39 novel). The leading locus encompasses MAPT, encoding the tau protein central to Alzheimer's disease. Genetic correlations revealed relationships with mental health, physical health, lifestyle and socioeconomic traits, including depressed mood, diabetes, alcohol intake and income. Mendelian randomization indicated a causal role of high blood pressure and type 2 diabetes in accelerated brain aging. Our study highlights key genes and pathways related to neurogenesis, immune-system-related processes and small GTPase binding, laying the foundation for further mechanistic exploration.

Use of long-acting injectable (LAI) antipsychotics in this population has not been systematically investigated. We aimed to compare risk of disease relapse, all-cause mortality, and adverse events associated with LAI versus oral antipsychotics among older people with schizophrenia. METHODS: In this population-based within-subject analysis, we used territory-wide electronic health records from the Clinical Database Analysis and Reporting System of the Hong Kong Hospital Authority. Individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia (ICD-9-CM code 295) in inpatient, outpatient, or emergency department settings between Jan 1, 1993, and Dec 31, 2023, were identified, and people aged 65 years and older who were prescribed LAI or oral antipsychotics between Jan 1, 2004, and Dec 31, 2023, were considered for inclusion. Individuals with incomplete demographic information were excluded. The primary outcome was disease relapse, defined as hospital admission for schizophrenia. The secondary outcomes comprised all-cause mortality and adverse events, including cardiovascular hospital admission, extrapyramidal symptoms, acute liver injury, and acute kidney injury, which were identified using ICD-9-CM codes or laboratory tests. A self-controlled case series study using Poisson regression was conducted to compare the risk of disease relapse and adverse events between the treatment periods of LAI and oral antipsychotics. An individual-stratified Cox regression was performed for all-cause mortality. Time-varying confounders, including age, season, class of antipsychotics, COVID-19 stringency index, and concomitant treatment with antidepressants, benzodiazepines or Z-drugs, mood stabilisers, and antiparkinsonian drugs, were adjusted for. People with lived experience of schizophrenia were not involved in the design or conduct of the study. FINDINGS: Of 24 985 older individuals with schizophrenia, 4696 (18·8%) were prescribed LAI or oral antipsychotics. 10 655 (42·6%) of 24 985 individuals were male and 14 330 (57·4%) were female. Data on ethnicity were not available. Compared with oral antipsychotics, LAI antipsychotics were associated with statistically significantly lower risk of hospital admission for schizophrenia (incidence rate ratio [IRR] 0·71 [95% CI 0·64-0·78], p<0·0001) and all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 0·23 [95% CI 0·12-0·44], p<0·0001). No statistically significant difference was found in cardiovascular hospital admissions, acute liver injury, and acute kidney injury. LAI antipsychotics were associated with increased risk of extrapyramidal symptoms (IRR 2·17 [1·24-3·80], p=0·0068), but only with first-generation (2·86 [1·41-5·84], p=0·0038) not second-generation LAI antipsychotics. INTERPRETATION: In older individuals with schizophrenia, LAI antipsychotics were associated with lower risk of disease relapse and mortality, without increased risk of adverse events, than oral antipsychotics, except for elevated risk of extrapyramidal symptoms specifically related to first-generation LAI antipsychotics. Overall, LAI antipsychotics, especially second-generation medications, could be more broadly considered for long-term use among this population, particularly at an early stage of disease.

The aim of our work was to evaluate the clinical practices of dermatologists in managing PPD, focusing on patient presentation, treatment preferences, and the need for further diagnostic evaluations. METHODS: We utilized a survey-based design for the present study. The survey was distributed to the Study Group on Cutaneous Vascular Diseases and Skin Ulcers of the Italian Society of Dermatology and Venereology. The survey collected data on the number of patients evaluated weekly, the proportion of patients requesting treatment, preferred therapeutic approaches, and indications for additional diagnostic tests. RESULTS: Twenty-four clinicians from 11 centers participated. Respondents reported managing an average of 5 PPD cases per week, with treatment required in approximately 50% of cases, while the remainder were incidental findings during evaluations for other dermatological conditions. Skin moisturizers and topical corticosteroids (tCS) were universally recommended as first-line treatments. Additional therapies included zinc oxide cream, compression stockings, and flavonoid-based oral supplements. Further diagnostic workups, such as leg Doppler ultrasound, skin biopsy, and blood tests, were considered necessary only in selected patients based on clinical presentation and comorbidities. CONCLUSIONS: Moisturizers and tCS are the cornerstone of PPD treatment, supplemented by tailored therapies and diagnostic evaluations. These findings highlight the need for standardized, evidence-based guidelines to optimize the management of PPD.	Italian journal of dermatology and venereology	01/10/2025

However, the underlying mechanisms are not completely understood. In this study, through genetically manipulating the glycolytic process by overexpressing human glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1), hexokinase 2 (HK2) and 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase-fructose-2,6-biphosphatase 3 (PFKFB3) in mouse skeletal muscle, we examined the impact of enhanced glycolysis in metabolic homeostasis. Enhanced glycolysis in skeletal muscle promoted accelerated glucose disposal, a lean phenotype and a high metabolic rate in mice despite attenuated lipid metabolism in muscle, even under High-Fat diet (HFD). Further study revealed that the glucose metabolite sensor carbohydrate-response element-binding protein (ChREBP) was activated in the highly glycolytic muscle and stimulated the elevation of plasma fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21), possibly mediating enhanced lipid oxidation in adipose tissue and contributing to a systemic effect. PFKFB3 was critically involved in promoting the glucose-sensing mechanism in myocytes. Thus, a high level of glycolysis in skeletal muscle may be intrinsically coupled to distal lipid metabolism through intracellular glucose sensing. This study provides novel insights for the benefit of resistance training and for manipulating insulin-independent glucose metabolism.	Journal of cellular and molecular medicine	01/08/2021
10.2147/IJWH.S410489	Magnitude and Factors Associated with Teenage Pregnancy in Somaliland: Evidence	Gensa Geta T, Ahmed Abdiwali S, Farah MM	PURPOSE: Teenage pregnancy is estimated to be common in Somaliland. It is linked with adverse perinatal outcomes. However, no study has been conducted in the country on this subject. Therefore, this study intended to assess the magnitude and factors associated with teenage pregnancy in Somaliland. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data from the 2020 Somaliland Health and Demographic Survey (SLHDS); were used in the current analysis. A total sample of 3,786 women in reproductive age groups were involved as participants. The survey used a two-level cluster sampling design, which included initial selection of enumeration areas followed by selection of households. To identify associated factors, binary logistic regression analysis was applied. RESULTS: The magnitude of teenage pregnancy was 47.2% (95%CI: 45.5-48.9%). Being a nomadic resident (AOR: 1.26; 95%CI: 1.12-1.71), being in the lowest wealth quintiles (AOR: 1.34; 95%CI: 1.01-1.77), being in the Sanaag region (AOR: 1.95;95%CI: 1.54-2.46) and having lower educational attainment (AOR: 2.29; 95%CI: 1.08-4.83) were significantly associated with teenage pregnancy. CONCLUSION: Teenage pregnancy is highly prevalent in Somaliland and associated with a lower educational level, lower wealth quintiles and nomadic residence. Hence, governmental and non-governmental organizations should work on educating and financially empowering women by giving particular focus to nomadic people.

10.7150/ijbs.70172	COVID-19 receptor and malignant cancers: Association of CTSL expression with	Zhang L, Wei C, Li D, He J, Liu S, Deng H, Cheng J, Du J, Liu X, Chen H, Sun S, Yu H, Fu J	CTSL is expressed by cancerous tissues and encodes a lysosomal cysteine proteinase that regulates cancer progression and SARS-CoV-2 entry. Therefore, it is critical to predict the susceptibility of cancer patients for SARS-CoV-2 and evaluate the correlation between disease outcomes and the expression of CTSL in malignant cancer tissues. In the current study, we analyzed CTSL expression, mutation rate, survival and COVID-19 disease outcomes in cancer and normal tissues, using online databases. We also performed immunohistochemistry (IHC) to test CTSL expression and western blot to monitor its regulation by cordycepin (CD), and N6, N6-dimethyladenosine (m(6)(2)A), respectively. We found that CTSL is conserved across different species, and highly expressed in both normal and cancer tissues from human, as compared to ACE2 or other proteinases/proteases. Additionally, the expression of CTSL protein was the highest in the lung tissue. We show that the mRNA expression of CTSL is 66.4-fold higher in normal lungs and 54.8-fold higher in cancer tissues, as compared to ACE2 mRNA expression in the respective tissues. Compared to other proteases/proteinases/convertases such as TMPRSS2 and FURIN, the expression of CTSL was higher in both normal lungs and lung cancer samples. All these data indicate that CTSL might play an important role in COVID-19 pathogenesis in normal and cancer tissues of the lungs. Additionally, the CTSL-002 isoform containing both the inhibitor_I29 and Peptidase_C1 domains was highly prevalent in all cancers, suggesting its potential role in tumor progression and SARS-CoV-2 entry in multiple types of cancers. Further analysis of the expression of CTSL mutant showed a correlation with FURIN and TMPRSS2, suggesting a potential role of CTSL mutations in modulating SARS-CoV-2 entry in cancers. Moreover, high expression of CTSL significantly correlated with a short overall survival (OS) in lung cancer and glioma. Thus, CTSL might play a major role in the susceptibility of lung cancer and glioma patients to SARS-CoV-2 uptake and COVID-19 severity. Furthermore, CD or m(6)(2)A inhibited CTSL expression in the cancer cell lines A549, MDA-MB-231, and/or PC3 in a dose dependent manner. In conclusion, we show that CTSL is highly expressed in normal tissues and increased in most cancers, and CD or m(6)(2)A could inhibit its expression, suggesting the therapeutic potential of targeting CTSL for cancer and COVID-19 treatment.

The aim of this study was to investigate the early super responder (ESR) profile (at week 4) to bimekizumab. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a multicenter retrospective study in 20 Dermatology outpatient clinics in Turkey. Adult patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis who were under bimekizumab for at least 12 weeks were enrolled. RESULTS: A total of 341 adult patients were included. 136 had nail psoriasis (39.9%), 148 had psoriatic arthritis (PsA) (43.4%), 223 (65.4%) had at least one difficult-to-treat area involvement, 155 (45.5%) were bio-naïve, 110 (32.5%) had ≥ 2 biologics history. At week 4, PASI75 was achieved in 144 patients (49.8%), PASI90 was achieved in 88 patients (30.4%), PASI100 was achieved in 51 patients (17.6%). Family history (p = 0.041), palmoplantar involvement (p = 0.008), PsA (p = 0.097), and bio-experienced status (p = 0.060) were associated with lower odds of being an ESR, whereas each 1-point increase in baseline PASI was associated with significantly lower odds of ESR (p < 0.001). Gender, age, disease duration, history of conventional systemic treatment, and presence of any comorbidity were not significantly associated with the likelihood of being an ESR (all p > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Bimekizumab is the effective treatment in both bio-naïve and bio-experienced patients; however, it may have a more rapid onset of action in bionaive patients. Further studies are needed on the long-term efficacy and safety data of bimekizumab.	The Journal of dermatological treatment	01/12/2025

However, despite fertilization with sperm, SCNT oocytes remained arrested at the metaphase stage, indicating activation failure. Artificial activation using a selective cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor successfully bypassed this arrest, inducing the segregation of somatic chromosomes into a zygotic pronucleus and a polar body. Comprehensive chromosome tracing via sequencing revealed that homologous chromosome segregation occurred randomly and without crossover recombination. Nonetheless, an average of 23 somatic chromosomes were retained within the zygote, demonstrating the feasibility of experimentally halving the diploid chromosome set. Fertilized human SCNT oocytes progressed through normal embryonic cell divisions, ultimately developing into embryos with integrated somatic and sperm-derived chromosomes. While our study demonstrates the potential of mitomeiosis for in vitro gametogenesis, at this stage it remains just a proof of concept and further research is required to ensure efficacy and safety before future clinical applications.

This includes adherent-invasive Escherichia coli (AIEC), particularly in patients with inflammatory bowel disease, in which dysbiosis creates a niche for this pathogen to colonize. There is an urgent and unmet need for novel narrow-spectrum and microbiome-sparing antibiotics. Here we screened 10,747 bioactive small molecules for antibacterial activity against AIEC and discovered enterololin, an antibacterial compound with targeted activity against Enterobacteriaceae species. Enterololin could overcome intrinsic and acquired resistance mechanisms in clinical isolates when combined with a subinhibitory concentration of SPR741, a polymyxin B analogue used here to increase outer membrane permeability in Gram-negative bacteria. Molecular substructure- and deep learning-guided mechanism-of-action investigations revealed that enterololin perturbs lipoprotein trafficking through a mechanism involving the LolCDE complex, laboratory-evolved resistant mutants predominantly mapped to lolC and lolE, with an in vitro frequency of resistance of ~10(-8) to 10(-7). Enterololin showed low mammalian cytotoxicity (HEK293 half-maximal inhibitory concentration ~100 µg ml(-1)) and suppressed AIEC infection in mouse models when administered in combination with SPR741, while largely preserving the overall microbiome composition. This study highlights the utility of deep learning methods for predicting molecular interactions and identifies a promising Enterobacteriaceae-specific antibacterial candidate for further development.

10.1186/s12974-025-03561-w	NLRP3 inflammasome and hearing loss: from mechanisms to therapies.	Murillo-Cuesta S, Seoane E, Cervantes B, Zubeldia JM, Varela-Nieto I	The NLRP3 inflammasome, a key component of the innate immune system, has emerged as a central mediator of inflammation-driven sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL). This review synthesizes current evidence on its involvement across a wide spectrum of auditory pathologies, including genetic syndromes such as CAPS and autosomal dominant deafness (DFNA) 34, as well as noise-induced, age-related, drug-induced, and viral hearing loss. Dysregulated activation of NLRP3 in the cochlea leads to the release of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1B and IL-18) and pyroptotic cell death, contributing to irreversible cochlear damage. Experimental studies have demonstrated that pharmacological inhibition of NLRP3 via agents such as MCC950, oridonin and tranylcypromine can preserve auditory function. Gain-of-function mutations in the NLRP3 gene are frequently associated with both syndromic and nonsyndromic hearing loss, and animal models expressing these mutations replicate cochlear inflammation and hearing deficits, validating their pathogenic role. Clinically, IL-1B signaling blockers such as anakinra and canakinumab have shown efficacy in CAPS patients, stabilizing or improving hearing outcomes. Emerging selective NLRP3 inhibitors, including dapansutrilo and MCC950, are progressing through early-phase clinical trials. Additionally, natural compounds such as piceatannol and oridonin have demonstrated otoprotective effects in preclinical models of noise- and drug-induced hearing loss. Collectively, these findings position the NLRP3 inflammasome as a promising therapeutic target for SNHL. Future translational research should focus on validating NLRP3-targeting compounds in human trials, identifying biomarkers for early diagnosis, and exploring combination therapies that integrate anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and regenerative strategies. Targeting NLRP3 may ultimately redefine treatment paradigms for preventing or halting progressive hearing loss.	Journal of neuroinflammation	04/10/2025

However, it remains unclear which patients benefit from the addition of CTLA-4 inhibitors. We aimed to evaluate whether dual checkpoint blockade with CTLA-4 and PD-L1 or PD-1 inhibitors provides similar efficacy to PD-L1 or PD-1 inhibitor monotherapy, or whether these strategies produce distinct outcomes across NSCLC subpopulations. METHODS: We conducted a search of PubMed, MEDLINE, and Embase for randomised phase 3 trials published from database inception to Nov 21, 2024, that investigated PD-L1 or PD-1 inhibitors, with or without CTLA-4 inhibitors, in patients with advanced NSCLC. We focused on studies reporting Kaplan-Meier survival data at 5 years or biomarker analyses based on PD-L1, KRAS, and STK11 mutational status. Individual patient data were extracted from Kaplan-Meier curves with WebPlotDigitizer version 5 and reconstructed with the IPDfromKM method. The primary endpoint of the study was 5-year overall survival in the overall population and in subpopulations based on PD-L1 tumour proportion score (TPS), tumour histology, and mutational status (mutant vs wild-type) of KRAS and STK11. This study was registered with PROSPERO, CRD420251081707. FINDINGS: The initial search yielded 1026 results, and six randomised clinical trials met the eligibility criteria and were included. Among the 2881 patients eligible for analysis (838 [29·1%] female and 2043 [70·9%] male), 1282 received dual CTLA-4 and PD-L1 or PD-1 blockade and 1599 received single PD-L1 or PD-1 blockade. Patients treated with dual CTLA-4 and PD-L1 or PD-1 blockade had similar median overall survival compared with those treated with single PD-L1 or PD-1 inhibition (16·1 months [95% CI 15·0-17·8] vs 16·9 months [15·5-18·3]; HR 0·95 [95% CI 0·87-1·03], p=0·19).

10.1016/j.immuni.2025.09.012	Inflammation in atherosclerosis: Lessons and therapeutic implications.	Libby P, Soehnlein O	Inflammatory pathways operate at all stages of atherosclerosis. These processes are driven by risk factors and other stimuli that can spark inflammation by eliciting misdirected responses of intrinsic vascular cells and leukocytes, culminating in lesion initiation, progression, and complication. Continuing dissection of the key underlying inflammatory mechanisms with increasingly sophisticated tools has inspired successful clinical trials and enabled translation to the clinic. Here, we review the mechanistic understanding of the etiology and progression of atherosclerosis. We discuss how cardiovascular risk factors converge at the level of the bone marrow to perturb hematopoiesis, yielding output with a pro-inflammatory slant. We further consider how circulating myeloid cells enter, propagate, and persist in atherosclerotic lesions and how intimal macrophages take center stage in regulating the inflammatory milieu. In this context, we delineate emerging therapeutic strategies aimed at mitigating inflammation in atherosclerosis and how these add to existing measures toward reducing the global cardiovascular disease burden.

The combination of mosunetuzumab, a T-cell-engaging bispecific antibody, and polatuzumab vedotin, an antibody-drug conjugate, (Mosun-Pola), represents a novel fixed-duration outpatient therapy. METHODS: In the phase 3 SUNMO trial, patients with refractory/relapsed LBCL who were ineligible for autologous stem cell transplant were randomized (2:1) to receive Mosun-Pola or rituximab, gemcitabine, and oxaliplatin (R-GemOx). Dual primary endpoints were centrally-assessed overall response rate and progression-free survival. Overall survival was a key secondary endpoint. RESULTS: A total of 208 patients were randomized to receive Mosun-Pola (n=138) or R-GemOx (n=70). At a median follow-up of 23.2 months, the primary analysis of SUNMO demonstrated that the median progression-free survival was significantly longer with Mosun-Pola than with R-GemOx(11.5 months [95% confidence interval (CI), 5.6-18] vs 3.8 months [95% CI, 2.9-4.1]; hazard ratio for progression or death, 0.41 [95% CI, 0.3-0.6]; P<0.0001). Overall response rate was significantly greater with Mosun-Pola versus R-GemOx (70% vs 40%; P<0.0001), with a complete response rate of 51% and 24%, respectively. In the Mosun-Pola group, the rate of grade ≥2 cytokine release syndrome and usage of tocilizumab occurred in less than 5% of patients, and patient-reported outcomes were improved compared with R-GemOx. CONCLUSION: Mosun-Pola demonstrated superior efficacy verus R-GemOx, with significant improvements in both overall response rate and progression-free survival, and infrequent cytokine release syndrome events with a manageable safety profile.(Funded by F.

10.1016/S2213-2600(25)00287-5	Dupilumab versus omalizumab in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal	De Corso E, Canonica GW, Heffler E, Springer M, Grzegorzek T, Viana M, Horváth Z, Mullol J, Gevaert P, Michel J, Peters AT, Wagenmann M, Zaghloul S, Zhang M, Corbett M, Nash S, Angello JT, Radwan A, Deniz Y, Martin A, Hellings PW	BACKGROUND: Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) is predominantly driven by type 2 inflammation. The biologics dupilumab and omalizumab, which target drivers and mediators of type 2 inflammation (interleukin [IL]-4/IL-13 signaling and immunoglobulin E [IgE], respectively), are efficacious in treating CRSwNP but direct comparisons are few. In EVEREST (EValuating trEatment RESponses of dupilumab versus omalizumab), the first head-to-head trial in respiratory biologics, we aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of dupilumab and omalizumab in patients with severe CRSwNP who had mild, moderate, or severe asthma. METHODS: EVEREST was an international, randomised, double-blind, phase 4 trial, conducted at 100 hospitals or clinical centres in 17 countries. Sites were selected with otolaryngology, pneumologist, allergist, and immunologist practices; needed to have previously conducted double-blind studies; and were required have nasal endoscopy and electrocardiogram machines. Eligible patients aged 18 years or older with severe uncontrolled CRSwNP (with a nasal polyp score of 5 or more [and ≥2 for each nostril]), symptoms of nasal congestion and loss of smell for at least 8 weeks before screening, and physician-diagnosed asthma. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to subcutaneous dupilumab 300 mg every 2 weeks or omalizumab weight-tiered and IgE-tiered dosing every 2 weeks or 4 weeks for 24 weeks, with background mometasone furoate nasal spray. Patients and investigators were masked to the study drugs. Primary endpoints were change from baseline in endoscopic nasal polyp score and University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT) at 24 weeks. Efficacy was assessed in the intention-to-treat population and safety was assessed in patients who received at least one dose of study medication. The trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04998604. FINDINGS: Between Sept 27, 2021, and Dec 27, 2024, 819 individuals were screened for study inclusion, 459 were excluded (most common screen failures were: 167 did not meet nasal polyp score ≥5 or did not have ongoing symptoms of nasal congestion and loss of smell, 114 did not meet pre-bronchodilator FEV(1) ≤85% predicted normal, and 99 did not meet eligibility as per omalizumab drug-dosing), and 360 participants were randomly assigned (181 assigned to the dupilumab group and 179 assigned to the omalizumab group). Of the 360 participants, 198 (55%) participants were male, 162 (45%) were female, and the mean age of the total population sample was 52 years (SD 13·1). Improvements were significantly greater with dupilumab than omalizumab for all primary and secondary efficacy endpoints at week 24. Least squares mean differences in change from baseline dupilumab over omalizumab were: nasal polyp score -1·60 (95% CI -1·96 to -1·25; p<0·0001) and UPSIT 8·0 (6·3 to 9·7; p<0·0001). 115 (64%) of 179 participants in the dupilumab group and 116 (67%) of 173 participants in the omalizumab group reported treatment-emergent adverse events, the most common of which were nasopharyngitis, accidental overdose, headache, upper respiratory tract infection, and cough. There were no deaths in the study. INTERPRETATION: Dupilumab was superior to omalizumab in patients with severe CRSwNP and coexisting asthma. These findings support the efficacy of dupilumab in patients with type 2 respiratory diseases versus an active biologic comparator, the known safety profiles of dupilumab and omalizumab, and could enable better treatment targeting for patients with CRSwNP and asthma in clinical practice.

Although proteostasis supports tumor growth, the mechanism by which ubiquitin ligases reprogram chaperone networks to drive metastasis is poorly understood. In this study, it is revealed that DDB1-CUL4-associated factor (DCAF12), a substrate receptor for CUL4-RING ubiquitin ligases, regulates metastatic progression through ubiquitin-mediated proteostatic reprogramming. DCAF12 depletion suppresses tumor cell migration and stemness in vitro and reduces pulmonary/hepatic metastasis in vivo. Mechanistically, DCAF12 catalyzes the non-degradative ubiquitination of TRiC/CCT subunits, enhancing chaperonin assembly and folding of cytoskeletal effectors (β-actin/tubulin) and oncogenic clients (STAT3/Raptor/mLST8), thereby activating the YAP, STAT3, and mTOR pathways. Both genetic knockdown and pharmacological blockade (via HSF1A) of this axis potently inhibit metastasis. Clinically, DCAF12 overexpression is correlated with YAP/STAT3 activation, advanced metastasis, and poor survival. Three key insights are revealed: 1) ubiquitination-mediated TRiC/CCT regulation as a metastatic switch, 2) DCAF12 as an oncogenic proteostasis hub, and 3) therapeutic potential validated through multimodal targeting. These findings establish the DCAF12-TRiC/CCT axis as a mechanistically novel target that simultaneously disrupts cytoskeletal dynamics and oncogenic signaling, making it a promising therapeutic strategy for metastatic lung cancer.

10.1002/cnr2.70357	Acinic Cell Carcinoma of the Breast: A Population-Based Clinicopathologic Study.	Skenderi F, Babu GR, Glamoclija U, Veledar E, Gatalica Z, Lamovec J, Vranic S	PURPOSE: Acinic cell carcinoma (ACC) of the breast is a very rare, primary salivary gland-type breast malignancy, with ~100 reported cases in the literature. Limited information about the clinical features and outcomes of patients with ACC is available. METHODS: We utilized the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database to identify ACC patients. For comparison, we also examined a cohort of invasive breast carcinomas of no special type (NST). RESULTS: Thirty ACC patients were identified among the more than 248 000 invasive breast carcinoma NST patients. ACCs were predominantly grade 3 carcinomas (44%) and were diagnosed at an earlier stage (67%). Hormone receptor (HR) and HER2 status data were available for only 13 patients, revealing molecular heterogeneity: HR-/HER2- (four patients), HR-/HER2+ (two patients), HR+/HER2- (four patients), and HR+/HER2+ (three patients). The median survival time for ACC patients was 19 months vs. 48 months for NST patients (p < 0.001). A complete-case approach was utilized for the adjusted analyses, restricting the sample to 46 257 patients without missing data on all relevant covariates. The adjusted Kaplan-Meier analysis indicated a more pronounced decline in survival probabilities among patients with ACC compared to those with NST, with the number at risk in the ACC group diminishing to four patients by the 30-month mark. In contrast, NST patients exhibited a more gradual decrease. In the multivariable Cox regression, which adjusted for age, TNM stage, HR/HER2, and chemotherapy, ACC histology was correlated with a 1.69-fold increase in the hazard of death (HR: 1.69; 95% CI: 0.63-4.56), although this result was not statistically significant. Age and advanced stage continued to be strong predictors of poor survival, and the inclusion of an age-time interaction enhanced the model fit. CONCLUSION: Acinic cell carcinoma of the breast is a very rare primary breast malignancy. Our study indicates potentially aggressive clinical behavior in mammary ACC; however, findings must be interpreted cautiously given inherent SEER limitations, especially regarding histologic and molecular subtyping accuracy. Further centralized studies are urgently needed for the accurate characterization of this rare entity.	Cancer reports (Hoboken, N.J.)	01/10/2025
10.1186/s12974-025-03546-9	Microglial glycolytic reprogramming in alzheimer's disease: association with	Lu N, Jin Z, Liu N, Zhu C, Wei H, Xu Q	BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by chronic neuroinflammation alongside amyloid-beta plaque and phosphorylated tau (p-Tau) tangle accumulation. Microglia, as resident immune cells, undergo glycolytic reprogramming that may exacerbate inflammation and impede toxic protein clearance. Specifically, the glycolytic enzyme pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) drives proinflammatory microglial phenotypes linked to neurodegeneration. This study investigates how PKM2-mediated microglial glycolytic reprogramming and inflammatory responses alongside Aβ/p-Tau clearance in human AD brains. METHODS AND RESULTS: Hippocampal-entorhinal cortex (HP-EC) tissues from 8 AD patients and 8 matched controls underwent multiplex immunohistochemistry and high-resolution spatial analysis. PKM2(+)Iba1(+) microglia density significantly increased in AD versus controls (p < 0.001), predominantly displaying a disease-associated microglial (HAM-like) phenotype (ABCA7(+)) with concurrent lipid-droplet accumulation (PLIN3(+); LDAM phenotype). Spatially, glycolytic PKM2(+)Iba1(+) microglia accumulated near Aβ plaques, p-Tau tangles, and cerebral vasculature. Notably, their distribution around plaques/tau showed anomalous increasing density with distance (p < 0.001), suggesting impaired chemotaxis. Perivascular localization lacked clear chemotactic gradients. Functionally, overall phagocytic activity (CD68(+)) decreased significantly in AD (p = 0.001), primarily attributed to PKM2- subsets, whereas PKM2(+)Iba1(+) microglia exhibited pronounced phagocytic exhaustion (PLIN2(+); p < 0.001), consistent around both Aβ and p-Tau lesions (all p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Our study establishes that microglial glycolytic reprogramming via PKM2 promotes a proinflammatory HAM-like phenotype, phagocytic exhaustion, and peri-pathological accumulation with aggregates and cerebral vessels. Targeting glycolytic pathways represents a viable therapeutic strategy for alleviating microglial dysfunction and neuroinflammation in AD.	Journal of neuroinflammation	02/10/2025

Georgakis MK, Melton P, Živković L, Kopczak A, Katsanos AH	Ischemic stroke caused by atherosclerosis is associated with the highest risk of recurrence among stroke etiologies, highlighting a residual risk that current secondary prevention strategies fail to address. Multiple lines of research implicate inflammation in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, including recent large cardiovascular outcome trials demonstrating that anti-inflammatory therapies can lower residual vascular risk in patients with coronary artery disease. Notably, low-dose colchicine, a long-used anti-inflammatory drug, has received approval for cardiovascular risk reduction in patients with atherosclerosis. However, translation of anti-inflammatory treatments to patients with ischemic stroke has been challenging, with the first colchicine trials showing neutral or conflicting results. In this study, we review the preclinical, genetic, and epidemiologic literature linking inflammation to atherosclerotic stroke; examine key findings of cardiovascular outcome trials for stroke prevention; and summarize completed and ongoing stroke-specific trials. We discuss the etiologic heterogeneity of ischemic stroke that may obscure anti-inflammatory treatment effects, highlighting the need for precision medicine approaches targeting patients with established atherosclerosis and vascular inflammation. Finally, we provide an overview of the emerging anti-inflammatory therapeutics that are under development for atheroprotection and outline a translational roadmap to accelerate clinical impact in stroke prevention.

Using single-cell RNA sequencing, flow cytometry, and immunofluorescence, we found that thymus-derived Treg cells infiltrate the injured spinal cord via peripheral blood around 3 days post-SCI. Treg cell depletion worsened SCI and impaired long-term recovery. Transcriptomic profiling revealed strong anti-inflammatory functions of Treg cells and the potential to regulate cholesterol metabolism in neighboring microglia. Further single-cell RNA sequencing uncovered the clonality of SCI-associated Treg cells. Major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC II) expression on microglia, not macrophages, was crucial for sustaining Treg cell numbers and neuroprotective function, with myelin-phagocytosing microglia-activated Treg cells showing significant neuroprotective effects. Treg cells mitigated microglial inflammation via CTLA-4 and upregulated the ATP-binding cassette transporter G1 (Abcg1) receptor in microglia, helping to manage myelin load and reduce lipid droplet formation. Our findings offer mechanistic insights into SCI-associated Treg cells and lay the groundwork for future Treg-based therapies in SCI treatment.	Neuron	29/09/2025

Orthologues of Hem1 in Dictyostelium discoideum, Drosophila melanogaster, and Caenorhabditis elegans are essential for cytoskeletal reorganization, embryonic cell migration, and morphogenesis. However, the in vivo functions of mammalian Hem1 are not known. Using a chemical mutagenesis strategy in mice to identify novel genes involved in immune cell functions, we positionally cloned a nonsense mutation in the Hem1 gene. Hem1 deficiency results in defective F-actin polymerization and actin capping in lymphocytes and neutrophils caused by loss of the Rac-controlled actin-regulatory WAVE protein complex. T cell development is disrupted in Hem1-deficient mice at the CD4(-)CD8(-) (double negative) to CD4(+)CD8(+) (double positive) cell stages, whereas T cell activation and adhesion are impaired. Hem1-deficient neutrophils fail to migrate in response to chemotactic agents and are deficient in their ability to phagocytose bacteria. Remarkably, some Rac-dependent functions, such as Th1 differentiation and nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB)-dependent transcription of proinflammatory cytokines proceed normally in Hem1-deficient mice, whereas the production of Th17 cells are enhanced. These results demonstrate that Hem1 is essential for hematopoietic cell development, function, and homeostasis by controlling a distinct pathway leading to cytoskeletal reorganization, whereas NF-kappaB-dependent transcription proceeds independently of Hem1 and F-actin polymerization.

To improve antitumour responses, we hypothesized that enabling CAR-T cells to secrete bifunctional fusion proteins consisting of a cytokine modifier such as TGFβ(trap), IL-15 or IL-12, combined with an immune checkpoint inhibitor such as αPD-L1, would provide tumour-localized immunomodulation to improve CAR-T cell functionality. Here we engineer CAR-T cells to secrete TGFβ(trap), IL-15 or IL-12 molecules fused to αPD-L1 scFv and assess in vitro functionality and in vivo safety and efficacy in prostate and ovarian cancer models. CAR-T cells engineered with αPD-L1-IL-12 are superior in safety and efficacy compared with CAR-T cells alone and those engineered with αPD-L1 fused with TGFβ(trap) or IL-15. Further, αPD-L1-IL-12 engineered CAR-T cells improve T cell trafficking and tumour infiltration, and localize IFNγ production, TME modulation and antitumour responses, with reduced systemic inflammation-associated toxicities. We believe our αPD-L1-IL-12 engineering strategy presents an opportunity to improve CAR-T cell clinical efficacy and safety across multiple solid tumour types.

Even though it is well established that the complex interplay between different cell types determines the overall healing response after MI, the precise changes in the tissue architecture are still poorly understood. In this study, we generated an integrative cellular map of the acute phase after murine MI using a combination of imaging-based transcriptomics (Molecular Cartography) and antibody-based highly multiplexed imaging (Sequential Immunofluorescence). This enabled us to evaluate cell type compositions and changes at subcellular resolution over time. We observed the recruitment of leukocytes to the infarcted heart through the endocardium and performed unbiased spatial proteomic analysis using Deep Visual Proteomics (DVP) to investigate the underlying mechanisms. DVP identified von Willebrand factor (vWF) as an upregulated mediator of inflammation 24 hours after MI, and functional blocking of vWF reduced the infiltration of C-C chemokine receptor 2 (Ccr2)-positive monocytes and worsened cardiac function after MI.

Here we identify an immune evasion mechanism present in 60% of AML cases, wherein primitive AML cells aberrantly express the lymphoid surface protein SLAMF6 (signaling lymphocyte activation molecule family member 6). Knockout of SLAMF6 in AML cells enables T cell activation and highly efficient killing of leukemia cells in coculture systems, demonstrating that SLAMF6 protects AML cells from recognition and elimination by the immune system in a mode analogous to the programmed cell death protein-ligand (PDL1/PD1) axis. Targeting SLAMF6 with an antibody against the SLAMF6 dimerization site inhibits the SLAMF6-SLAMF6 interaction and induces T cell activation and killing of AML cells both in vitro and in humanized in vivo models. In conclusion, we show that aberrant expression of SLAMF6 is a common and targetable immune escape mechanism that could pave the way for immunotherapy in AML.	Nature cancer	03/10/2025

Since the discovery of streptokinase in 1933, several additional fibrinolytic agents have been developed. Two plasminogen activators-urokinase and tissue plasminogen activator (tPA)-were identified in human samples. Through recombinant DNA technology, tPA was cloned and modified to produce alteplase.

Among the microbial agents, Fusobacterium nucleatum has emerged as a prominent contributor, frequently detected in CRC tissues and associated with advanced disease stages and poor prognosis. This review highlights the complex interplay between F. nucleatum and host non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), including microRNAs (miRNAs), long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), and circular RNAs (circRNAs), in modulating CRC biology. F. nucleatum influences the expression of several ncRNAs, which in turn regulate key signaling pathways such as Wnt/β-catenin (e.g., miR-1246, miR-135b), PI3K/AKT (e.g., miR-22, miR-135b), and TLR4/NF-κB (e.g., miR-31, lnc-NEAT1). Through these mechanisms, F. nucleatum contributes to tumor cell proliferation, immune evasion, metastasis, and chemoresistance. Additionally, its impact on ncRNA expression is implicated in reduced efficacy of standard chemotherapy. Emerging microbiota-based therapies, including probiotics and fecal microbiota transplantation, show promise in modulating gut flora and potentially reversing ncRNA dysregulation; however, their mechanistic effects on the F. nucleatum-ncRNA axis require further investigation. This review underscores the critical role of F. nucleatum-regulated ncRNAs in CRC and presents new opportunities for biomarker discovery and targeted therapeutics.	Gut pathogens	04/10/2025

Given the long pre-clinical phase of many ageing conditions, we aimed to examine the legacy effect (post-trial) and the longer-term effect of aspirin versus placebo through extended follow-up in the ASPREE-XT observational study. METHODS: Between March 10, 2010, and Dec 24, 2014, 19 114 community-dwelling people in Australia and the USA, aged predominantly 70 years and older, were randomly assigned to low-dose aspirin or placebo for a median of 4·7 years as part of the ASPREE trial. Post-trial observational follow-up continued for a median of 4·3 years (IQR 4·1-4·6). All components of the primary endpoint (ie, incident dementia, persistent physical disability, and death) were adjudicated by masked expert panels. Analyses used Cox proportional hazards models with intention-to-treat. FINDINGS: 15 633 participants (8836 [56·5%] were women, 6797 [43·5%] were men; 981 [6·3%] were not White) were eligible for and agreed to observational follow-up. There was no effect of randomisation to aspirin (34·37 events per 1000 person-years) versus placebo (33·68 per 1000 person-years) on the primary endpoint (hazard ratio [HR] 1·02; 95% CI 0·94-1·11; p=0·63) in the ASPREE-XT period. Similarly, over the period of both ASPREE and ASPREE-XT, no long-term effect of aspirin versus placebo was observed on the composite outcome of death, dementia, or persistent physical disability over almost a decade of follow-up (HR 1·01; 95% CI 0·95-1·08; p=0·65), including no long-term effect on deaths (1·06; 0·99-1·14; p=0·10). No effect of aspirin on incident major haemorrhagic events as compared with placebo was found in ASPREE-XT; however, aspirin was associated with an increased hazard for incident major haemorrhagic events across both ASPREE and ASPREE-XT (1·24; 1·10-1·39). INTERPRETATION: Low-dose aspirin does not appear to be effective in promoting a healthy lifespan in initially healthy, community-dwelling older people.

CKLF-like MARVEL transmembrane domain containing member 6 (CMTM6) stabilizes PD-L1 surface expression and modulates tumor immunity in solid cancer. In this study, we found a role for FLT3-induced CMTM6 in hematological malignancies. FLT3 drove CMTM6 and PD-L1 expression in AML cells, while FLT3 inhibition reduced expression of CMTM6 and PD-L1. In three distinct allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation mouse models, transplantation of Cmtm6 deficient FLT3-ITD+ leukemia cells resulted in prolonged survival, reduced leukemia burden, enhanced T cell effector function, and decreased expression of T cell exhaustion markers compared to Cmtm6 proficient FLT3-ITD+ leukemia cells. Furthermore, combination therapy with anti-PD-L1 and tandutinib significantly improved survival, suppressed leukemia cell expansion, and augmented the anti-leukemia T cell response in mice bearing FLT3-ITD+ leukemia. Mechanistically, protein-protein interaction of FLT3 and CMTM6 within their transmembrane domains, which was not phosphorylation dependent, enhanced CMTM6 stability in leukemia cells, while FLT3-ITD did not increase CMTM6 and PD-L1 expression at the RNA level. Furthermore, CMTM6 upregulation and protein interaction with FLT3 was validated in primary leukemia cells from two independent cohorts of patients with FLT3-ITD+ AML. Collectively, these findings uncover FLT3-mediated stabilization of CMTM6 in AML cells, which results in enhanced PD-L1 cell surface expression and leukemia immune escape.	Cancer research	03/10/2025

Platelets are emerging as key players in the pathogenesis of MG, bridging innate and adaptive immunity. We analyze platelet transcriptome signatures and their interactions with the immune system in AChR+ immunotherapy-naïve MG (nMG) patients using bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). nMG patients exhibit upregulation of genes related to activation, inflammation, and cytoskeletal regulation. Increased platelet count, activation, altered morphology, enhanced CD62P expression, and elevated plasma CD40L levels are observed in PBMCs, which diminish with minimal clinical status (MMS). Functionally, platelets show heightened interactions with leukocytes, forming aggregates that correlate with disease severity. These features return to baseline after intravenous immunoglobulin or prolonged immunosuppressive therapy. This study underscores platelet activation's critical role in MG and supports platelet-targeted therapy.	Nature communications	02/10/2025

Fueyo R, Wang S, Crocker OJ, Swigut T, Nakauchi H, Wysocka J	Stem cell-based human embryo models offer a unique opportunity for functional studies of the human-specific features of development. Here we genetically and epigenetically manipulate human blastoids, a 3D embryo model of the blastocyst(1), to investigate the functional effect of HERVK LTR5Hs, a hominoid-specific endogenous retrovirus, on pre-implantation development. We uncover a pervasive cis-regulatory contribution of LTR5Hs elements to the hominoid-specific diversification of the epiblast transcriptome in blastoids. Many of the LTR5Hs genomic insertions in the human genome are unique to our own species. We show that at least one such human-specific LTR5Hs element is essential for the blastoid-forming potential via enhancing expression of the primate-specific ZNF729 gene, encoding a KRAB zinc-finger protein. ZNF729 binds to GC-rich sequences, abundant at gene promoters associated with basic cellular functions, such as cell proliferation and metabolism. Despite mediating recruitment of TRIM28, at many of these promoters ZNF729 acts as a transcriptional activator. Together, our results illustrate how recently emerged transposable elements and genes can confer developmentally essential functions in humans.	Nature	01/10/2025

The circuit-level mechanisms underlying these distinct symptom domains remain poorly understood, and treatments that address both cognitive and noncognitive aspects of AD are limited. Here, we identify anatomically, molecularly, and functionally distinct subpopulations of supramammillary (SuM) neurons that project to either the dorsal or ventral dentate gyrus (dDG or vDG). These distinct SuM neurons and their SuM-DG subcircuits selectively regulate memory and emotion, respectively. In AD model mice, SuM neurons targeting dDG or vDG display aberrant activity during memory or emotional processing, and importantly, targeted optogenetic activation of SuM-dDG or SuM-vDG pathways selectively restores cognitive or affective function. These findings reveal SuM-DG subcircuits as parallel modulators of cognitive and emotional states and highlight their potential as therapeutic targets for addressing the multifaceted symptomatology of AD.

Neurological examination revealed right ophthalmoplegia. CT angiography and MRI identified a right persistent trigeminal artery (PTA), right persistent hypoglossal artery, and bovine aortic arch. The right internal carotid artery (ICA) was displaced laterally in the cavernous sinus due to the bifurcation of the PTA. Compression of the right oculomotor nerve, right trochlear nerve, and first division of the right trigeminal nerve by the elongated right ICA was noted and considered a potential cause of the ophthalmoplegia and orbital pain. Symptoms improved with normalization of blood pressure. During embryonic development, the right posterior communicating artery and bilateral vertebral arteries were aplastic or hypoplastic, which suggests that these carotid-basilar anastomoses may have remained as supply routes to provide sufficient blood flow to the posterior cerebral circulation. This is an extremely rare case of embryological implications manifested with neurovascular compression syndrome. (Received 6 January, 2022; Accepted 17 February, 2022; Published 1 June, 2022).

Although previous studies have focused on characterising PASC in children and adolescents after an initial infection, the risks of PASC after reinfection with the omicron variant remain unclear. We aimed to assess the risk of PASC diagnosis (U09.9) and symptoms and conditions potentially related to PASC in children and adolescents after a SARS-CoV-2 reinfection during the omicron period. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study used data from 40 children's hospitals and health institutions in the USA participating in the Researching COVID to Enhance Recovery (RECOVER) Initiative. We included patients younger than 21 years at the time of cohort entry; with documented SARS-CoV-2 infection after Jan 1, 2022; and who had at least one health-care visit within 24 months to 7 days before the first infection. The second SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed by positive PCR, antigen tests, or a diagnosis of COVID-19 that occurred at least 60 days after the first infection. The primary endpoint was a clinician-documented diagnosis of PASC (U09.9). Secondary endpoints were 24 symptoms and conditions previously identified as being potentially related to PASC. We used the modified Poisson regression model to estimate the relative risk (RR) between the second and first infection episodes, adjusted for demographic, clinical, and health-care utilisation factors using exact and propensity-score matching. FINDINGS: We identified 407 300 (87·5%) of 465 717 eligible children and adolescents with a first infection episode and 58 417 (12·5%) with a second infection episode from Jan 1, 2022, to Oct 13, 2023, in the RECOVER database. 233 842 (50·2%) patients were male and 231 875 (49·8%) were female. The mean age was 8·17 years (SD 6·58). The incident rate of PASC diagnosis (U09.9) per million people per 6 months was 903·7 (95% CI 780·9-1026·5) in the first infection group and 1883·7 (1565·1-2202·3) in the second infection group. Reinfection was associated with a significantly increased risk of an overall PASC diagnosis (U09.9) (RR 2·08 [1·68-2·59]) and a range of symptoms and conditions potentially related to PASC (RR range 1·15-3·60), including myocarditis, changes in taste and smell, thrombophlebitis and thromboembolism, heart disease, acute kidney injury, fluid and electrolyte disturbance, generalised pain, arrhythmias, abnormal liver enzymes, chest pain, fatigue and malaise, headache, musculoskeletal pain, abdominal pain, mental ill health, POTS or dysautonomia, cognitive impairment, skin conditions, fever and chills, respiratory signs and symptoms, and cardiovascular signs and symptoms.

10.1186/s11658-025-00789-5	Programmed cell death in triple-negative breast cancer.	Liu Y, He J, Chen J, Chen T, Li W, Yang Z, Zeng F	Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a particularly aggressive and therapeutically challenging subtype of breast cancer, defined by the lack of estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 expression. This absence of actionable molecular targets contributes to its resistance to conventional treatments. This review provides an overview of the mechanistic functions, interrelated processes, and therapeutic implications of several programmed cell death (PCD) pathways-including apoptosis, pyroptosis, necroptosis, autophagy, and ferroptosis-in the context of TNBC pathogenesis and treatment. A conceptual framework is proposed for leveraging these interconnected cell death pathways as a basis for novel targeted interventions. Given the complex interplay among various PCD forms characterized by shared features such as inflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and overlapping molecular mediators, this integrated network offers promising opportunities for combinatorial therapeutic strategies. Modulation of one cell death pathway may influence others, potentially amplifying therapeutic efficacy. Furthermore, these PCD pathways are highly relevant to immunotherapy outcomes, offering a foundation for synergistic treatment modalities. This review provides an in-depth analysis of the crosstalk between immune-based therapies and PCD, along with a comprehensive discussion of derived therapeutic approaches. However, tumor diversity, resistance mechanisms, and discrepancies between preclinical models and human physiology pose major challenges in applying these findings clinically. The overarching goal is to present innovative insights and strategies to enhance the clinical management of TNBC and ultimately improve patient outcomes.

Yet existing spatial transcriptomics tools are still limited in either transcriptomic coverage or spatial resolution, hindering unbiased, hypothesis-free transcriptomic analyses at high spatial resolution. Here, we develop reverse-padlock amplicon-encoding fluorescence in situ hybridization (RAEFISH), an image-based spatial transcriptomics method with whole-genome coverage and single-molecule resolution in intact tissues. We demonstrate the spatial profiling of transcripts from 23,000 human or 22,000 mouse genes in single cells and tissue sections. Our analyses reveal transcript-specific subcellular localization, cell-type-specific and cell-type-invariant zonation-dependent transcriptomes, and gene programs underlying preferential cell-cell interactions. Finally, we further develop our technology for the direct spatial readout of guide RNAs (gRNAs) in an image-based, high-content CRISPR screen. Overall, these developments offer a broadly applicable technology that enables high-coverage, high-resolution spatial profiling of both long and short, native and engineered RNAs in many biomedical contexts.

Over the past five years, the development of YAP-TEAD disruptors has emerged as a central focus of both academic and industrial efforts aimed at targeting the Hippo pathway for cancer therapy. In this study, the discovery and comprehensive characterization of KG-FP-003, a potent, selective, and durable TEAD degrader is reported. KG-FP-003 exhibits superior activity compared to the lipid-binding pocket (LBP) inhibitor MYF-03-176 and the TEAD-YAP protein-protein interaction (PPI) inhibitor IAG933, efficiently degrading all TEAD isoforms at low nanomolar concentrations in a ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS)-dependent manner. This degradation translates into more robust and sustained therapeutic responses both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, barcoded cell line screening revealed elevated sensitivity in several cancer types, including endometrial carcinoma, glioblastoma, ovarian epithelial tumors, and osteosarcoma. These findings position KG-FP-003 as a compelling lead candidate for TEAD isoform-selective therapies and underscore its potential utility beyond Hippo-dysregulated mesothelioma.

10.2337/db25-0215	Regulatory Roles of IGF2R in Insulin Secretion and Adaptive β-Cell Proliferation.	Shirakawa J, De Jesus DF, Tsuno T, Basile G, Inoue R, Takatani T, Nishiyama A, Okawa ER, Tamura T, Terauchi Y, Kulkarni RN	Insulin-like growth factor-2 receptor (IGF2R), also known as cation-independent mannose-6-phosphate receptor, is localized in cytosolic vesicles and is unique in its ability to transport enzymes to the lysosome and to clear IGF2 from the cell surface by acting as a scavenger receptor. To evaluate the direct role of IGF2R in β-cell biology, we undertook complementary in vitro knockdown and in vivo knockout approaches. A β-cell line with a stable knockdown of IGF2R (IGF2RKD) exhibited decreased glucose-induced insulin secretion and enhanced cell proliferation. Tamoxifen-inducible β-cell-specific IGF2R knockout mice exhibited impaired glucose tolerance and blunted insulin secretion after high-fat-diet loading that was likely secondary to reduced β-cell mass due to attenuated proliferation. β-cells with IGF2RKD had fewer autophagosomes after starvation and reduced expression of p62, LC3B, and ULK1. Aged mice also had impaired autophagy in βIGF2R-deficient β-cells. Reduced IGF2R function and N6-methyladenosine (m6A) mRNA methylation were observed in islets from both mouse and human type 2 diabetes. Taken together, these data point to IGF2R as an important regulator of insulin secretion, cell proliferation, and autophagy in mammalian β-cells. ARTICLE HIGHLIGHTS: The significance of insulin-like growth factor-2 receptor (IGF2R) in β-cells remains unclear. To assess the physiological role of IGF2R in β-cells, the effects of IGF2R deficiency in vivo and in vitro were investigated. IGF2R modulates insulin secretion, cell proliferation, and autophagy in β-cells. IGF2R plays a role in the regulation of β-cell biology.	Diabetes	03/10/2025

Addressing this knowledge gap is critical given the persistent global mortality burden of GC and the limited efficacy of current therapeutic strategies. METHODS: BRD9 expression in GC patients was systematically analyzed using immunohistochemical (IHC) assays and transcriptomic datasets. Comprehensive functional validation, employing cellular and murine tumor models, elucidated BRD9's role in GC progression. Molecular pathways underlying BRD9-mediated gastric carcinogenesis were delineated through integrated approaches, including RNA sequencing, co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP), subcellular fractionation, and luciferase reporter assays. RESULTS: BRD9 was significantly overexpressed in GC and associated with poor patient prognosis. Functionally, BRD9 promoted GC cell proliferation and enhanced DNA damage repair capacity. Mechanistically, elevated BRD9 expression inhibited p53 nuclear translocation via direct binding, subsequently activating the E2F transcription factor family. Notably, we identified that E2F1 directly bound to and transactivated the BRD9 promoter, establishing a positive feedback loop that sustains BRD9 expression. Additionally, BRD9 knockdown sensitized GC cells to cisplatin and oxaliplatin treatment. CONCLUSIONS: These findings highlight the critical role of BRD9 in GC progression and its therapeutic potential. The BRD9-p53-E2F1 axis acts as a crucial regulator of GC cell proliferation and DNA damage response. Targeting BRD9 pharmacologically could be a novel therapeutic approach to enhance chemotherapy efficacy and improve treatment outcomes in GC patients.	Molecular cancer	02/10/2025
10.1186/s13062-016-0107-8	A paneukaryotic genomic analysis of the small GTPase RABL2 underscores the	Eliáš M, Klimeš V, Derelle R, Petrželková R, Tachezy J	"BACKGROUND: The cilium (flagellum) is a complex cellular structure inherited from the last eukaryotic common ancestor (LECA). A large number of ciliary proteins have been characterized in a few model organisms, but their evolutionary history often remains unexplored. One such protein is the small GTPase RABL2, recently implicated in the assembly of the sperm tail in mammals. RESULTS: Using the wealth of currently available genome and transcriptome sequences, including data from our on-going sequencing projects, we systematically analyzed the phylogenetic distribution and evolutionary history of RABL2 orthologs. Our dense taxonomic sampling revealed the presence of RABL2 genes in nearly all major eukaryotic lineages, including small ""obscure"" taxa such as breviates, ancyromonads, malawimonads, jakobids, picozoans, or palpitomonads. The phyletic pattern of RABL2 genes indicates that it was present already in the LECA. However, some organisms lack RABL2 as a result of secondary loss and our present sampling predicts well over 30 such independent events during the eukaryote evolution. The distribution of RABL2 genes correlates with the presence/absence of cilia: not a single well-established cilium-lacking species has retained a RABL2 ortholog. However, several ciliated taxa, most notably nematodes, some arthropods and platyhelminths, diplomonads, and ciliated subgroups of apicomplexans and embryophytes, lack RABL2 as well, suggesting some simplification in their cilium-associated functions. On the other hand, several algae currently unknown to form cilia, e.g., the ""prasinophytes"" of the genus Prasinoderma or the ochrophytes Pelagococcus subviridis and Pinguiococcus pyrenoidosus, turned out to encode not only RABL2, but also homologs of some hallmark ciliary proteins, suggesting the existence of a cryptic flagellated stage in their life cycles. We additionally obtained insights into the evolution of the RABL2 gene architecture, which seems to have ancestrally consisted of eight exons subsequently modified not only by lineage-specific intron loss and gain, but also by recurrent loss of the terminal exon encoding a poorly conserved C-terminal extension. CONCLUSIONS: Our comparative analysis supports the notion that RABL2 is an ancestral component of the eukaryotic cilium and underscores the still underappreciated magnitude of recurrent gene loss, or reductive evolution in general, in the history of eukaryotic genomes and cells."

Early in the regeneration process, pro-inflammatory macrophages contribute to immune imbalance, while in later stages, senescent stem cells reduce regenerative capacity. Here we demonstrate that nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD(+)) can reprogramme both types of dysfunctional cell. We developed a spatiotemporal-adaptive nanotherapeutic system for the delivery of NAD(+) into selected cells during different phases of tissue repair. By replenishing intracellular NAD(+) pools, this system reshapes the multicellular regeneration niche, by metabolically rewiring pro-inflammatory macrophages towards a pro-repair phenotype during the early phase, and enhancing the differentiation capacity of senescent stem cells at later stages. This strategy effectively restored impaired bone regeneration in osteoporotic mice and accelerated skin wound healing. Our work presents a spatiotemporal-adaptive nanomedicine platform that bridges cell metabolism, nanomedicine and regeneration therapy.	Nature nanotechnology	01/10/2025
10.1093/braincomms/fcaf337	Systemic increase of AMPA receptors associated with cognitive impairment of long	Fujimoto Y, Abe H, Eiro T, Tsugawa S, Tanaka M, Hatano M, Nakajima W, Ichijo S, Arisawa T, Takada Y, Kimura K, Sano A, Hirahata K, Sasaki N, Kimura Y, Takahashi T	Long COVID primarily presents with persistent cognitive impairment (Cog-LC), imposing a substantial and lasting global burden. Even after the pandemic, there remains a critical global need for diagnostic and therapeutic strategies targeting Cog-LC. Nevertheless, the underlying neural mechanisms remain poorly understood. Given the central role of synapses in brain function, investigation of synaptic molecular changes may provide vital insights into Cog-LC pathophysiology. In this study, we used [(11)C]K-2 PET to characterize the density of AMPA receptors (AMPARs) on the post-synaptic cell surface, which are crucial synaptic components in brain signalling. Statistical parametrical mapping was used to spatially normalize and apply independent t-test for a voxel-based comparison. We selected patients with Cog-LC (n = 30) based on Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status assessed persistent cognitive impairment and healthy controls (n = 80) with no diagnosed neuropsychiatric disorders. The primary objective was to compare [(11)C]K-2 standardized uptake value ratio with white matter (SUVR(WM)) as a reference region between patients with Cog-LC and healthy controls, and to define the regional extent of differences. The secondary objective was to examine associations between [(11)C]K-2 SUVR(WM) and plasma concentrations of cytokines or chemokines. As an exploratory objective, we tested whether [(11)C]K-2 PET data could distinguish Cog-LC from healthy controls using a partial least squares based classification algorithm. A voxel-based comparison (P < 0.05, T > 1.66, one-tailed, false discovery rate control) and a volume of interests analysis (P < 0.05, Bonferroni multiple comparison) demonstrated that increased index of AMPAR density in large parts of the brains of patients with Cog-LC compared with that in healthy controls. A voxel-based correlation analysis also showed the brain regions where [(11)C]K-2 SUVR(WM) correlated positively with plasma TNFSF12 and negatively with plasma CCL2 concentrations. A partial least squares model trained on the index of AMPAR density data demonstrated high diagnostic accuracy, achieving 100% sensitivity and 91.2% specificity. [(11)C]K-2 PET signal represents the index of AMPAR density on the post-synaptic neural cell surface, not on the glial cell surface. A systemic increase in synaptic AMPARs across the brain may drive abnormal information processing in Cog-LC and, through excessive excitatory signalling, pose a risk of excitotoxic neuronal damage. We derived the hypothesis that [(11)C]K-2 PET would be helpful in establishing a diagnostic framework for Cog-LC and that antagonists for cell surface AMPARs, such as perampanel, would be a potential therapeutic target. These hypotheses should be investigated in future large-scale clinical studies.	Brain communications	01/01/2025

Nutraceuticals (NUTs) containing both Monacolin K (MK) and Morus alba have been shown to be more effective in lowering lipids compared to NUT formulations containing only MK. However, the effects of these NUTs on glucose homeostasis have not been fully determined. METHODS: To evaluate the association between LDL-C-lowering therapy and glycemia in patients receiving NUT combinations with or without Morus alba, we analyzed data from a prospective, randomized, active-treatment controlled trial (NCT02898805), which enrolled 359 patients to compare the effects of a NUT combination containing MK alone (Formulation 1, F1; n = 170) versus one containing MK and Morus alba (Formulation 1, F2; n = 189). RESULTS: Participants in the two treatment arms (F1 vs. F2) were comparable in terms of sex, age, metabolic parameters, and BP. After 3 months, both groups experienced significant reductions in LDL-C, fasting plasma glucose, HbA1c, and HOMA index. F2 treatment led to a significantly greater reduction in glycemic levels compared to F1 treatment (b = - 16, p < 0.001). Notably, a divergent trend emerged over time: an inverse relationship between LDL-C and glycemic levels was observed in the F1 group, while a significant direct association between LDL-C and glycemic levels was detected in the F2 group (b = 0.06, p = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our findings indicate that the treatment with a NUT combination containing Morus alba simultaneously reduces plasma levels of LDL-C and glucose.

In humans, the clinical diagnosis is often dependent on the emergence of motor symptoms. However, cognitive impairments and metabolic changes can be early indicators. HD mouse models are a useful tool to understand disease progression, however, relatively few studies have monitored the timeline for the emergence of cognitive indices with motor and metabolic phenotypes in parallel. In this study, cognitive, motor, and metabolic phenotypes were investigated at different ages in the zQ175 knock-in mouse alongside immunohistochemical and long-term potentiation (LTP) studies. We demonstrated that zQ175 mice developed impaired hippocampal LTP at 3-months and cognitive deficits in visuospatial attention were evident by 4-months. Long-term and spatial memory impairments emerged by 12-months, alongside motor impairments. Additionally, an anxiolytic-like phenotype emerged at 6-months. Differences in body weight were also detected from 6-months onwards, primarily driven by a reduction in fat mass. Additionally, reduced brain weight and the presence of huntingtin aggregates in the hippocampus, striatum and hypothalamus were observed at 12-months. These data support the zQ175 mouse as a model of HD, which recapitulates many aspects of the disease progression in humans and can be used to understand mechanisms underlying the disease.

10.1016/j.amjcard.2022.01.027	Usefulness of Empagliflozin Versus Oral Semaglutide for Prevention of	Hammerman A, Moore CM, Aboalhasan E, Azuri J, Arbel R	Empagliflozin and oral semaglutide reduce the incidence of cardiovascular mortality (CVM) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. However, these therapies impose a significant financial burden on healthcare systems. Therefore, we compared the value for money of empagliflozin versus oral semaglutide to prevent CVM. We calculated the cost needed to treat to prevent 1 case of CVM using either drug by multiplying the annualized number needed to treat to prevent 1 event by the annual cost of the therapy. Efficacy estimates were extracted from published randomized controlled trials data. We performed a scenario analysis to mitigate the primary differences between the populations of randomized controlled trials. Drug costs were calculated as 75% of the United States National Average Drug Acquisition Cost listing. The annualized number needed to treat for empagliflozin in EMPA-REG-OUTCOME was 141 (95% confidence interval [CI] 104 to 230) and 141 (95% CI 96 to 879) for oral semaglutide in PIONEER 6. The annual treatment costs are $4,797 for empagliflozin versus $7,133 for oral semaglutide. Therefore, the corresponding costs needed to treat are $676,385 ($498,894-$1,101,039) and $1,005,855 (95% CI $684,837-$6,270,544) respectively. In conclusion, our findings suggest that empagliflozin provides better value for money than oral semaglutide to prevent CVM in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus at the current United States prices of the interventions.

10.1186/s12889-025-24746-1	Associations between sarcopenic obesity and risk of falls: a population-based	Yu C, Meng Z, Wang X, Xiao J	OBJECTIVES: Although previous research has established a strong link between sarcopenia and fall risk in middle-aged and older adults, the effects of sarcopenic obesity and possible sarcopenic obesity on fall risk remain underexplored in large-scale studies. This longitudinal analysis aimed to examine these associations using nationally representative cohort data. METHODS: We analyzed data from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS), including 9,996 participants aged 45 and older with available body composition measurements. Participants were categorized into four groups based on Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia (AWGS) criteria and median waist circumference (WC): (1) normal WC without sarcopenia (control group), (2) normal WC with sarcopenia, (3) obesity without sarcopenia, and (4) obesity with sarcopenia. Cox proportional hazards model was used to estimate adjusted hazard ratios (HRs), 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and P-values, with the control group as the reference. The model was sequentially adjusted for demographic (age, sex, residence), socioeconomic (education), and behavioral (smoking, alcohol) variables. RESULTS: Compared to participants with normal WC and no sarcopenia (reference group), those with sarcopenic obesity had a significantly higher risk of falls (HR = 1.25; 95% CI: 1.00-1.56; P = 0.048), even after adjusting for demographic, socioeconomic, and behavioral factors. Similarly, possible sarcopenic obesity was linked to a modest but statistically significant increase in fall risk (HR = 1.12; 95% CI: 1.02-1.24; P = 0.021). Subgroup analyses revealed that the fourth quartile showed a trend toward higher fall risk across all subgroups, especially among individuals aged ≥ 60 years and males. However, in most Subgroups, the 95% CIs cross 1, suggesting limited statistical significance in some strata. CONCLUSIONS: Both sarcopenic obesity and possible sarcopenic obesity are associated with an elevated risk of falls. Middle-aged and older adults should adopt preventive strategies, such as maintaining regular physical activity, to preserve muscle mass and reduce the risk of falls.	BMC public health	03/10/2025
10.1371/journal.pone.0071955	Smoking, radiotherapy, diabetes and osteoporosis as risk factors for dental	Chen H, Liu N, Xu X, Qu X, Lu E	BACKGROUND: There are conflicting reports as to the association between smoking, radiotherapy, diabetes and osteoporosis and the risk of dental implant failure. We undertook a meta-analysis to evaluate the association between smoking, radiotherapy, diabetes and osteoporosis and the risk of dental implant failure. METHODS: A comprehensive research on MEDLINE and EMBASE, up to January 2013, was conducted to identify potential studies. References of relevant studies were also searched. Screening, data extraction and quality assessment were conducted independently and in duplicate. A random-effects meta-analysis was used to pool estimates of relative risks (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: A total of 51 studies were identified in this meta-analysis, with more than 40,000 dental implants placed under risk-threatening conditions. The pooled RRs showed a direct association between smoking (n = 33; RR = 1.92; 95% CI, 1.67-2.21) and radiotherapy (n = 16; RR = 2.28; 95% CI, 1.49-3.51) and the risk of dental implant failure, whereas no inverse impact of diabetes (n = 5; RR = 0.90; 95% CI, 0.62-1.32) on the risk of dental implant failure was found. The influence of osteoporosis on the risk of dental implant failure was direct but not significant (n = 4; RR = 1.09; 95% CI, 0.79-1.52). The subgroup analysis indicated no influence of study design, geographical location, length of follow-up, sample size, or mean age of recruited patients. CONCLUSIONS: Smoking and radiotherapy were associated with an increased risk of dental implant failure. The relationship between diabetes and osteoporosis and the risk of implant failure warrant further study.	PloS one	01/01/2013

This study evaluated a dexamethasone-sparing regimen of daratumumab plus lenalidomide versus lenalidomide plus dexamethasone in frail patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma. METHODS: In this prospective, randomised, open-label trial, conducted at 61 active Intergroup Francophone of Myeloma centres, patients aged 65 years or older with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group proxy frailty score of 2 or more were randomly assigned 2:1 to receive daratumumab (1800 mg subcutaneously) plus oral lenalidomide (25 mg daily for 21 days of a 28 day cycle) and dexamethasone (20mg weekly) for two cycles (dexamethasone-sparing group) or lenalidomide (25 mg daily) and oral dexamethasone (20 mg weekly; control group), with stratification by International Staging System, age, and centre. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival. Efficacy was assessed in the intention-to-treat population and safety was assessed in all patients exposed to at least one dose of randomised intervention. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03993912, and is complete. FINDINGS: From Oct 18, 2019 to July 20, 2021, 335 patients were screened, of whom 295 patients were randomly assigned (200 to lenalidomide plus daratumumab, 95 to lenalidomide plus dexamethasone). The median age was 81 years (IQR 77-84), with 180 (61%) aged older than 80 years, and 151 (51%) patients were female and 144 (49%) were male. Median follow-up was 46·3 months (IQR 46·0-52·7). Median progression-free survival was 53·4 months (95% CI 35·3-not reached) in the dexamethasone-sparing group versus 22·5 months (16·5-39·0) in the control group (hazard ratio [HR] 0·51, 95% CI 0·37-0·70, p<0·0001). The most common grade 3-5 AEs were neutropenia (110 [55%] of 200 patients in the dexamethasone-sparing group vs 23 [24%] of 95 patients in the control group), and infection (38 [19%] vs 20 [21%]). Serious adverse events occurred in 126 patients (63%) in the dexamethasone-sparing group and 66 patients (69%) in the control group. AEs leading to death occurred in 23 patients (12%) in the dexamethasone-sparing group and 12 patients (13%) in the control group, with 4 (2%) and 2 (2%) grade 5 treatment-emergent adverse events, respectively. INTERPRETATION: In the IFM2017-03 trial, use of lenalidomide plus daratumumab, with dexamethasone limited to the first 2 treatment cycles, reduced the risk of progression or death compared with lenalidomide plus dexamethasone, with no additional safety concerns. Lenalidomide plus daratumumab could therefore be considered as a treatment option for older patients with frailty and newly diagnosed multiple myeloma.

10.1371/journal.pone.0048639	The neural correlates of identity faking and concealment: an FMRI study.	Ding XP, Du X, Lei D, Hu CS, Fu G, Chen G	The neural basis of self and identity has received extensive research. However, most of these existing studies have focused on situations where the internal representation of the self is consistent with the external one. The present study used fMRI methodology to examine the neural correlates of two different types of identity conflict: identity faking and concealment. Participants were presented with a sequence of names and asked to either conceal their own identity or fake another one. The results revealed that the right insular cortex and bilaterally inferior frontal gyrus were more active for identity concealment compared to the control condition, whereas identity faking elicited a significantly larger percentage signal increase than the control condition in the right superior frontal gyrus, left calcarine, and right caudate. These results suggest that different neural systems associated with both identity processing and deception were involved in identity concealment and faking.	PloS one	01/01/2012

We discovered dysregulated gene expression and alternative splicing (AS) throughout iMN development and maturation, and iMNs with mutations in ALS-associated genes displayed enrichment of cytoskeletal defects and synaptic alterations from the premature stage to mature iMNs. Our findings indicate that synaptic gene dysfunction is a common molecular hallmark of familial ALS, which may result in neuronal susceptibility and progressive motor neuron degeneration. Analysis of upstream splicing factors revealed that differentially expressed RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) in iMNs from patients with ALS may cause abnormal AS events. Overall, our research provides a comprehensive and valuable resource for gaining insights into the shared mechanisms of familial ALS pathogenesis during motor neuron development and maturation in iMN models.

10.1248/bpb.b15-00842	Mechanism Underlying Induction of Hyperglycemia in Rats by Single Administration	Nagata M, Nakajima M, Ishiwata Y, Takahashi Y, Takahashi H, Negishi K, Yasuhara M	Acute administration of olanzapine rapidly elevates blood glucose levels. However, the mechanism underlying the rapid development of hyperglycemia with the administration of olanzapine remains unclear. The aim of the present study was to clarify the mechanism underlying olanzapine-induced acute hyperglycemia. Male Wistar rats received an intravenous infusion of saline (control) or olanzapine 2.5, 5, or 10 mg/kg. Blood samples were obtained periodically after olanzapine infusion to determine serum concentrations of glucose, olanzapine, and several endogenous substances. In a separate experiment, rats received an intravenous injection of propranolol (2 mg/kg) 30 min before infusion of olanzapine (10 mg/kg). The intravenous infusion of olanzapine induced dose-dependent increases in the serum concentrations of glucose, epinephrine, and insulin. Pretreatment with propranolol suppressed olanzapine-induced elevations in the serum concentration of glucose, but did not affect the serum concentration of olanzapine or olanzapine-induced increase in the serum concentration of epinephrine. Although the serum concentration of corticosterone increased after administration of olanzapine, no significant differences were observed among the olanzapine dose groups. Furthermore, administration of olanzapine did not affect the serum concentration of glucagon or histamine. We developed a pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic model assuming that the olanzapine-induced secretion of epinephrine leads to elevated serum glucose concentrations. This model appeared to satisfactorily characterize olanzapine-induced hyperglycemia. In conclusion, a single intravenous dose of olanzapine dose-dependently increased the serum concentration of glucose in rats, and epinephrine plays a role in olanzapine-induced acute hyperglycemia.

We aimed to evaluate the feasibility, performance, and clinical impacts of a rapid pan-microbial respiratory metagenomic service for patients admitted to intensive care units (ICUs). METHODS: This was a single-centre observational study of a rapid metagenomics service that tests respiratory samples from ICU patients at Guy's and St Thomas' hospitals, London, UK, between Dec 5, 2023, and April 12, 2024. Testing used a previously published pan-microbial metagenomics workflow, which simultaneously detects bacteria, fungi, and DNA and RNA viruses; provides same-day preliminary results after 2 h; and provides final results after 24 h. Patients were included if they were aged 18 years or older, admitted to the ICU, had confirmed respiratory failure requiring supplemental oxygen or advanced airway support, and had at least one of the following: (1) clinical suspicion of lower respiratory tract infection based on clinical, biochemical, or radiological findings, (2) sepsis of unknown origin, and (3) concern from an intensive care physician regarding inflammatory pathology. Patients with a suspected or confirmed containment level three organism were excluded. The outcome was performance characteristics of the metagenomic test compared with routine diagnostic testing, detection of additional pathogens by metagenomics, change in antimicrobial prescribing within 24 h of testing, and initiation of immunomodulation. FINDINGS: We processed 114 samples (1-5 per day) from 74 patients (39 [53%] female and 35 [47%] male). 107 (94%) of 114 samples passed quality control, of which 101 (94%) provided same-day preliminary results. Bacteria were detected in 45 (43%) of 104 tested specimens, fungal organisms in 17 (16%) of 104 tested specimens, and viruses in 28 (34%) of 83 tested specimens. Sensitivity in lower respiratory tract samples after 24 h was 97% (95% CI 87-100) for bacteria, 89% (65-99) for fungi, and 89% (71-98) for viruses, with only one false positive for bacteria. Metagenomics identified 42 pathogens not detected by other tests in 32 (30%) of 107 samples. Antimicrobial therapy was changed after metagenomic results from 30 (28%) of 107 samples: 22 (21%) were de-escalated and eight (7%) were escalated. Metagenomics contributed to the initiation of immunomodulation in 15 (20%) of 74 patients for a range of inflammatory conditions. Pathogens with clinical significance to local infection control or national public health were found in ten (14%) of 74 patients, including three invasive Group A streptococci, two parvovirus B19, and one each of HIV-1, measles virus, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Neisseria meningitidis, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. INTERPRETATION: Respiratory metagenomics for ICU patients showed good performance and turnaround time, and diverse clinical and public health benefits. This ability to inform both personalised patient therapy and infectious disease surveillance needs evaluation in multicentre studies. FUNDING: None.	The Lancet. Microbe	01/10/2025

From a previous phase 2 neoadjuvant immunotherapy window-of-opportunity study, we present the single-cell RNA and T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing analysis of 57 pre- and post-treatment tumor biopsies from head and neck cancer patients treated with durvalumab (anti-PD-L1) alone or with tremelimumab (anti-CTLA-4), identifying key cellular and molecular predictors of immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) response. Malignant cells and neutrophil senescence promote ICI response. While CXCL13(+) exhausted T (Tex) cells enhance response through 4-1BB signaling, anti-CTLA-4 induces 4-1BB(+) regulatory T cells (Tregs) restricting ICI efficacy. These opposing roles of 4-1BB in different cellular contexts may explain the limited benefit of combinatorial immunotherapy observed in clinical trials. We identify two subsets of tumor-reactive progenitor Tex (Tpex): ICI-responsive Tpex1 and ICI-resistant Tpex2, a subset characterized by KLRB1 and IL17R. The balance of Tpex1 and Tpex2 associates with ICI response across multiple cancers, offering insights into sustaining response. This study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03737968).

We aimed to investigate which initial systemic treatment should be prioritised in this population. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study conducted across 17 centres in the USA, Italy, France, and Brazil, clinicopathological data were collected from participants aged 18 years and older with stage IV, treatment-naive, metastatic BRAF(V600E)-mutated NSCLC and with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-3, who started first-line treatment with ICIs with or without chemotherapy (PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitors with or without platinum-based chemotherapy) or BRAF and MEK inhibitors (dabrafenib and trametinib or encorafenib and binimetinib) between Jan 2, 2015, and July 11, 2024. The primary endpoint was overall survival with first-line ICIs with or without chemotherapy versus with BRAF and MEK inhibitors. FINDINGS: 284 participants were identified for this study, of whom 88 (31%) received ICIs with or without chemotherapy and 196 (69%) received BRAF and MEK inhibitors. The median age of participants was 68 years (IQR 61-74), and 148 (52%) participants were female and 136 (48%) male. Participants in the ICIs with or without chemotherapy group had a higher history of smoking (73 [83%] vs 118 [60%]; p=0·0002) and a higher PD-L1 expression (≥50% in 58 [66%] vs 76 [39%], 1-49% in 16 [18%] vs 67 [34%], and <1% in eight [9%] vs 31 [16%]; p=0·0003) than those in the BRAF and MEK inhibitor group. At a median follow-up time of 45·0 months (95% CI 39·0-55·7), ICIs with or without chemotherapy were associated with improved median overall survival compared with BRAF and MEK inhibitors (40·9 months [95% CI 33·3-not reached] vs 25·2 months [19·9-31·1]; hazard ratio [HR] 0·69 [0·49-0·98], p=0·039). In subgroup analyses, ICIs with or without chemotherapy, compared with BRAF and MEK inhibitors, were associated with longer median overall survival in participants with a history of smoking (HR 0·60 [0·40-0·90], p=0·013), with a PD-L1 tumour proportion score of ≥1% or higher (HR 0·66 [0·45-0·98], p=0·039), aged 70 years or older (HR 0·54 [0·31-0·94], p=0·029), with TP53 co-mutations (HR 0·46 [0·27-0·79], p=0·0048), and without brain metastases (HR 0·66 [0·45-0·99], p=0·045). With BRAF and MEK inhibitors, frequencies of adverse events of any grade and of grade 3 and higher were similar whether administered as first-line therapy or as second-line therapy following ICIs with or without chemotherapy. INTERPRETATION: First-line ICIs with or without chemotherapy were associated with improved overall survival compared with BRAF and MEK inhibitors in participants with metastatic BRAF(V600E)-mutated NSCLC, particularly among specific subpopulations. These findings, although suggesting potential clinical relevance, remain exploratory and require confirmation from prospective studies. FUNDING: NextGenerationEU.	The Lancet. Oncology	01/10/2025

Godoy JB, Vialle RA, Dos Santos L, Raittz RT, Wang Y, Menon V, De Jager PL, Schneider JA, Tasaki S, Bennett DA, Guizelini D, de Paiva Lopes K	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative condition linked to chronic neuroinflammation. This study investigates the cytokine gene expression profile in cortical tissue samples from elderly individuals with and without AD to identify potential biomarkers and enhance our understanding of disease pathogenesis. Utilizing high-depth RNA sequencing data, we identified a set of cytokines whose expression significantly associated with different aspects of the AD phenotype, including measures of neurofibrillary tangles, amyloid-β deposition, and a person-specific rate of cognitive decline. Single-nucleus transcriptomics data facilitated the identification of specific cell types, such as microglia and astrocytes, that significantly contribute to the inflammatory response in AD. Additionally, we observed a correlation between the expression of certain cytokines and genetic risk for the disease. Our findings indicate that cytokine-mediated neuroinflammation may play an important role in neurodegeneration and that modulating the immune response may offer a promising strategy for developing new therapies.

Nevertheless, the mechanisms of communication between these cell types are not well understood. Previous studies have revealed a unique subset of macrophages that express triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (Trem2) in kidneys of human patients and mice with DN. Here, we explored the characteristics and the function of Trem2+ macrophages in the progress of DN. RNA-sequencing of macrophages in kidneys of Trem2 knockout (KO) mice fed a high-fat diet plus streptozotocin (HFD/STZ) revealed functional enrichment of metabolic processes, cytokine production, positive regulation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) cascades, and the regulation of phagocytosis. In vivo studies demonstrated that Trem2+ macrophages reduced lipid accumulation and mitigated ferroptosis of TECs in diabetic mice. Mechanistically, Trem2-deficient macrophages amplified the production of interleukin-1β (IL-1β) through activating the ERK signaling pathway. Furthermore, IL-1β triggered CD36 expression via the transcription factor NF-κB. Bioinformatics and functional assays showed NF-κB binds the CD36 promoter, which directly bound to the promoters of CD36 to facilitate its transcription.

10.52225/narra.v2i2.78	Hepatitis E virus in pigs and the environment: An updated review of public health	Ahmad T, Jin H, Dhama K, Yatoo MI, Tiwari R, Bilal M, Dhawan M, Emran TB, Alestad JH, Alhani HM, BinKhalaf HK, Rabaan AA	Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is an important public health problem and is responsible for both acute and chronic viral hepatitis. Public health implications of HEV are derived from its transmission route, either water-borne or food-borne, and its zoonotic potential. Not only in developing countries, but HEV cases are also found in a high number in developed countries. The spread of HEV to the environment might pollute surface waters, which could act as the source of infection for both humans and animals. Identification of the virus in animal products suggests the circulation of HEV within water and food chains. High seroprevalence and circulation of HEV in livestock, in particular pigs, as well as in environmental samples warrants further investigation into pig markets. HEV virulence in different environments and meat supply chains could shed light on the possible sources of infection in humans and the degree of occupational risk. The purpose of this review is to discuss HEV infections with an emphasis on livestock- and environment-related risk factors, and food-borne, water-borne, and zoonotic transmissions.

10.1186/s12943-025-02458-9	Microbiome-metabolome interplay in pancreatic cancer progression: insights from	Luo D, Chen Q, Li Y, Yang J, Tao Y, Ji L, Gong X	BACKGROUND: Recent studies suggest that intratumoral microbiome and altered metabolic networks play crucial roles in pancreatic cancer (PC) progression. However, the precise interplay between microbial communities and tumor metabolism in PC remains poorly understood. This study aims to investigate the impact of the intratumoral microbiome, the metabolic landscape, and their interactions on PC development. METHODS: 16S rDNA sequencing and Untargeted metabolomic profiling were performed on 47 paired pancreatic cancer and adjacent normal tissues to analyze their intratumoral microbiome and metabolic landscapes. Bioinformatics tools were used to conduct differential microbiome abundance analysis and pathway enrichment. A correlation analysis was performed to identify key microbiota-metabolite interactions. RESULTS: 16S rDNA sequencing revealed significant differences in the abundance and diversity (α-diversity and β-diversity) of the intratumoral microbiome in PC. The predominant species in pancreatic cancer were Pseudomonas. Enrichment analysis showed that amino acid metabolic pathways, including Arginine and Proline Metabolism, Arginine Biosynthesis, were significantly enriched in PC. Untargeted metabolomics identified 298 metabolites that were significantly altered in PC (fold change > 1.5, P-value < 0.05). These included amino acid metabolites such as Lys-Leu, Pro-Leu, Arg-Leu, Lys-Val, His-Lys, and others. Functional enrichment analysis highlighted several metabolic pathways that play important roles in pancreatic cancer, including Glycine, Serine, and Threonine Metabolism, Amino Acid Biosynthesis, Metabolic Pathways and Cysteine and Methionine Metabolism. Correlation analysis between microbiome and metabolic data revealed significant associations between Pseudomonas and several metabolites, including Alpha-ketoisovaleric acid, 16-hydroxyhexadecanoic acid, Myristic acid, Nonanoic acid (the Spearman correlation coefficient r, 0.5 ≤|r|≤ 1 and P-value < 0.05). CONCLUSION: This study suggests a relationship between the microbiome and metabolism in pancreatic cancer. We observed that Pseudomonas contributes to altered amino acid metabolism, but whether this interaction is causal and the mechanisms underlying it remain unclear. Further experimental validation is required before considering microbiome-targeted metabolic interventions as viable therapeutic strategies.	Molecular cancer	02/10/2025
10.1093/eurheartj/ehaf766	Taurochenodeoxycholic acid alleviates obesity-induced endothelial dysfunction.	Lu H, Wu Z, Wan M, Xiong S, Huang X, Liu T, Jiang X, He L, Ma C, Cui H, Yue X, Li J, Qin X, Wang Y, Zhang C, Yang J, Liu S, Zhang W	BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Obesity is a global health challenge significantly increasing cardiovascular disease (CVD) burden. Effective prevention and treatment necessitate targeting early pathological changes, particularly obesity-induced endothelial dysfunction (ED). This study aimed to characterize ED heterogeneity in non-hypertensive obese (NHO) individuals, investigate the association of serum metabolites with obesity-induced ED, and identify potentially predictive and therapeutic metabolites. METHODS: Utilizing wire myograph, this study assessed ED of ex vivo arterioles from omental adipose tissue of 213 NHO patients, categorized into metabolically healthy obesity (MHO) and metabolically unhealthy obesity (MUO). Targeted metabolomic profiling identified associations between serum metabolites and ED. RESULTS: Obesity-induced ED in NHO patients lacked correlations with many traditional cardiovascular risk factors. The MHO and MUO individuals exhibited similar ED and metabolomic profile characteristics. Serum metabolomics identified bile acids (BAs), particularly chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), as negatively correlated with ED in NHO patients. Taurochenodeoxycholic acid (TCDCA), a taurine-conjugated derivative of CDCA, protected against obesity-induced ED and hypertension. Mechanistically, endothelial Farnesoid X receptor (FXR) deletion aggravated obesity-induced ED and hypertension, negating the beneficial effects of bariatric surgery or TCDCA treatment. The TCDCA-FXR activation in endothelial cells upregulated ATF4 transcription, which was suppressed by PHB1, thereby enhancing serine and one-carbon metabolism. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests CDCA as a promising biomarker for identification of obesity-induced ED. Taurochenodeoxycholic acid demonstrates significant therapeutic potential for alleviating various forms of obesity-induced ED. This effect is mediated by the endothelial TCDCA-FXR-PHB1-ATF4 axis, which upregulates serine and one-carbon metabolism, thereby offering a novel strategy to delay the onset of hypertension and other CVDs.

This bibliometric analysis reviewed 498 publications from Web of Science and Scopus (2000-2023) to explore the evolution, status, thematic trends, data modalities and their ethical focus, and solutions in ophthalmic AI ethics. Ophthalmology ranks second in medical AI ethics, with major contributors from the United States (US), China, the United Kingdom (UK), Singapore and India. Ethical concerns focus on privacy, fairness, and transparency. Ethical priorities differ by modality with fundus imaging (59.4%) and Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) (30.9%) as the most common. Most studies (78.3%) address ethics in diagnostic algorithm development, while only 11.5% directly target ethical concerns, though this focus is increasing. This study highlights the need for AI technologies and guidelines to address ethical challenges in ophthalmology, offering a future direction for research and innovation in medical AI governance.

10.1016/j.redox.2025.103869	PARK7-driven IGF2BP3-K76 lactylation mediates ferroptosis and HAIC resistance in	Zhu Z, Xia X, Lu Y, Li D, He X, Zhang B, Xiong G, Zhang W, Liang H, Zhu H	Oxaliplatin/5-fluorouracil (OXA/5-FU)-based hepatic artery infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) represents a promising strategy against advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), yet acquired resistance frequently impedes its efficacy. Here, we identify lactylation of IGF2BP3 at lysine 76 (IGF2BP3-K76lac) as a key driver of HAIC resistance. IGF2BP3-K76lac overexpression enhances chemoresistance in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, lactylation at IGF2BP3 K76 strengthens its affinity for m6A-modified FSP1 mRNA, upregulating FSP1 and conferring ferroptosis resistance. Blocking of IGF2BP3-K76lac bolsters OXA/5-FU-induced ferroptosis, disrupts antioxidant defenses, and curbs tumor growth. Moreover, PARK7 functions as a lactyltransferase to facilitate IGF2BP3-K76lac via increasing the binding of lactate at IGF2BP3-K76 site. Finally, blocking antibody targeting IGF2BP3-K76lac was shown to work synergistically with OXA/5-FU to restore chemosensitivity. Taken together, our findings reveal a critical role for the PARK7-IGF2BP3-K76lac-FSP1 axis in HAIC resistance, highlighting IGF2BP3-K76lac as a potential therapeutic target in HCC.

We studied a cohort of 29 healthy individuals who received three mRNA vaccinations against SARS-CoV-2 before a breakthrough infection. We characterized the magnitude, phenotype, and clonal composition of CD8 T cell responses against 16 epitope specificities by ELISpot; flow cytometry; and single-cell RNA, protein, and T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing. One hundred six TCRs from five epitope-specific repertoires were reexpressed and tested for peptide sensitivity. Whereas vaccination-recruited T cell repertoires were enriched for high-avidity TCRs, differential clonal expansion was not linked to fine avidity differences. Instead, maintenance of polyclonality ensured robustness in counteracting viral mutational escape through altered epitopes. Deciphering the functionality of human antigen-specific T cell repertoires instructs our understanding of human T cell biology and may guide the development of vaccines and other immunotherapies.

10.3389/fnagi.2025.1617106	Understanding Parkinson's disease: current trends and its multifaceted	Chaudhary SA, Chaudhary S, Rawat S	"BACKGROUND: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a multifactorial, progressive neurodegenerative disorder that primarily affects dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. In addition to hallmark motor symptoms, it manifests a wide range of nonmotor complications, including cognitive decline, neuropsychiatric symptoms, autonomic dysfunction, and comorbid metabolic and infectious diseases. OBJECTIVES: This review aims to elucidate the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying PD, explore the influence of genetic and environmental factors, evaluate current treatment limitations, and assess the clinical and socioeconomic burden globally. Emphasis is placed on emerging therapeutic avenues and innovative research directions. METHODS: A structured literature review was conducted using PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases. The search included articles published between 2010 and 2025, using keywords: ""Parkinson's disease,"" ""α-synuclein,"" ""dopaminergic degeneration,"" ""ferroptosis,"" ""deep brain stimulation,"" ""stem cell therapy,"" and ""AI in PD diagnosis."" RESULTS: The review highlights a multifactorial etiology involving α-synuclein pathology, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, genetic mutations (SNCA, LRRK2, VPS35), environmental toxins, and gut dysbiosis. Comorbidities such as HIV, diabetes, and cardiovascular disorders exacerbate disease burden. While Levodopa remains the gold standard, its limitations necessitate combination therapy and adjunct modalities such as deep brain stimulation and nanocarrier-based drug delivery. Emerging approaches-stem cell therapy, CRISPR-Cas9, and AI-enhanced diagnostics-show promise. CONCLUSION: PD management requires a paradigm shift toward precision medicine. Advancing research into biomarkers, immunotherapy, and systems biology, coupled with equitable access to care and early diagnosis tools, is critical to mitigating the global impact of PD."

This study aims to examine the association of social isolation, loneliness and their combined effects with incident cancer. METHODS: This study utilized data from the UK Biobank (UKB), which is a population-based prospective cohort. Social isolation and loneliness were assessed through self-reported questionnaires. Cancer cases were identified by linking to cancer registries. RESULTS: A total of 430,376 participants were included, during a mean follow-up of 14.32 years, 45,131 participants were diagnosed with cancer. Compared to participants in least isolated group, those in most isolated group had significantly higher risks of cancer of lip, oral cavity and pharynx (HR 1.32, 95% CI 1.11-1.58), cancer of digestive organs (HR 1.10, 95% CI 1.03-1.16), cancer of respiratory and intrathoracic organs (HR 1.17, 95% CI 1.07-1.28), breast cancer (HR 1.11, 95% CI 1.04-1.18), cancer of female genital organs (HR 1.23, 95% CI 1.09-1.38), and cancer of urinary tract (HR 1.31, 95% CI 1.17-1.46). However, the most isolated group had lower risks of cancer of mesothelial and soft tissue (HR 0.80, 95% CI 0.64-0.99), prostate cancer (HR 0.88, 95% CI 0.83-0.94). Individuals with loneliness had a significantly increased risk of cancer of urinary tract (HR 1.19, 95% CI 1.01-1.40), but a reduced risk of cancer of skin (HR 0.76, 95% CI 0.61-0.93). CONCLUSIONS: Social isolation and loneliness were independently associated with incident cancer, with implications for early effective cancer prevention.	BMC public health	01/10/2025

10.1002/ijgo.70577	Paracetamol (acetaminophen) use during pregnancy and autism risk: Evidence does	Louwen F, Deuster E, McAuliffe FM, Jacobsson B, Geary M, Fleischman S, Kihara AB	Recent political statements linking paracetamol (acetaminophen) use during pregnancy to autism spectrum disorders have created concern among patients and healthcare providers worldwide. This editorial critically examines the scientific evidence, highlighting that the largest and most methodologically rigorous population-based studies employing sibling control analyses demonstrate no causal association between prenatal paracetamol exposure and neurodevelopmental disorders. While some observational studies have suggested potential weak associations, these findings likely reflect confounding by indication and familial genetic factors rather than actual causal relationships. The most robust evidence comes from a Swedish population-based study of 2.48 million children, which found no increased risk when controlling for familial confounding. Major international medical organizations including ACOG, RCOG, and FIGO, and regulatory agencies including the European Medicines Agency continue to recommend paracetamol as the safest analgesic option during pregnancy when clinically indicated. The established risks of untreated pain and fever during pregnancy significantly outweigh theoretical concerns based on methodologically limited studies. Healthcare providers should continue evidence-based counseling while avoiding unnecessary anxiety about this essential medication in obstetric practice.

10.1038/s41591-025-03972-5	Varicella-zoster virus reactivation and the risk of dementia.	Polisky V, Littmann M, Triastcyn A, Horn M, Georgiou A, Widenmaier R, Anspach B, Tahrat H, Kumar S, Buser-Doepner C, Geldsetzer P, Van Duijn CM, Schwab P	Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) is a neurotropic virus that establishes lifelong latency in humans. VZV reactivation is associated with a wide range of symptoms, including herpes zoster (HZ; also known as shingles), and has been implicated in the development of dementia, although to an unknown extent. Here we present a large-scale longitudinal analysis of health records from more than 100 million individuals in the United States that demonstrates a consistent relationship of VZV reactivation with dementia after controlling for nearly 400 measured characteristics (covering demographics, socioeconomic factors, comorbidities, medications, proxies for healthcare-seeking behavior, shifts in clinical guidelines and completeness of records). We found that recurrent HZ was associated with an increased risk of dementia compared to a single HZ episode. Additionally, exposure to HZ vaccines was associated with a reduced risk of dementia compared to the control 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine. Furthermore, the reduced risk of dementia after administration of the live-attenuated zoster vaccine waned over time and was highly correlated with a waning of the vaccine-mediated protection against HZ. The dementia risk reduction at 3 and 5 years postexposure was also stronger in individuals who received multiple as opposed to only one dose of the recombinant HZ vaccine and those at greater risk of HZ. Our findings strongly implicate VZV reactivation as a modifiable risk factor for dementia.	Nature medicine	06/10/2025

However, its applications to sexually transmitted infections (STIs) remain unclear. OBJECTIVE: To assess the performance of AI algorithms and their applications in detecting STIs and anogenital dermatoses from clinical images in sexual health. DATA SOURCES: Six databases (IEEE Xplore, Embase, Scopus, Medline, Web of Science, and CINAHL) were searched for studies published from January 1, 2010, to April 12, 2024, using 3 main concepts: artificial intelligence, diagnosis, and sexually transmitted infections. STUDY SELECTION: Studies that used AI to identify anogenital skin conditions from clinical images were included. Studies that used non-AI approaches or nonanogenital conditions, as well as reviews and studies lacking performance metrics, were excluded. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, 2 reviewers independently assessed full-text articles and extracted data using a standardized spreadsheet. Another 2 reviewers resolved any disagreements. A modified Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) critical appraisal tool and the Checklist for Evaluation of Image-Based AI Reports in Dermatology (CLEAR Derm) were used for quality assessment. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Pooled sensitivity and specificity of AI applications for detecting anogenital skin conditions. A bivariate random-effects meta-analysis was conducted for conditions with more than 3 studies. RESULTS: Of 5381 studies screened and 258 full texts selected, 140 met the inclusion criteria. Most studies reported on mpox (110 [78.6%]), while other anogenital conditions, including genital herpes (7 [5.0%]), genital warts (8 [5.7%]), scabies (8 [5.7%]), and molluscum contagiosum (6 [4.3%]), received less attention. Meta-analyses showed high performance of AI for identification of mpox (pooled sensitivity: 0.96 [95% CI, 0.93-0.97]; pooled specificity: 0.98 [95% CI, 0.97-0.99]), herpes simplex (sensitivity: 0.91 [95% CI, 0.71-0.98]; specificity: 0.97 [95% CI, 0.94-0.98]), genital warts (sensitivity: 0.87 [95% CI, 0.67-0.96]; specificity: 0.98 [95% CI, 0.95-0.99]), psoriasis (sensitivity: 0.90 [95% CI, 0.78-0.95]; specificity: 0.98 [95% CI, 0.96-0.99]), and scabies (sensitivity: 0.89 [95% CI, 0.84-0.93]; specificity: 0.98 [95% CI, 0.95-0.99]). Study quality was variable, and the assessment identified high risk of bias across the population selection (76.1%), reference standards (76.1%), and index tests (20.0%). Most studies relied on open-source datasets (121 [86.4%]); only 17 (12.1%) used external validation. All but 1 study (0.7%) remained at the proof-of-concept stage, and models were not publicly available for external evaluation. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The findings suggest that AI shows promise in identifying STIs and anogenital dermatoses but that significant research gaps exist. Future work should prioritize understudied STIs and differential conditions while improving data quality, conducting external validation, and validating findings in clinical settings.

10.1038/s41582-025-01142-2	Parkinson disease is a fatty acidopathy.	Fanning S, Selkoe D	On the basis of extensive mechanistic research over three decades, Parkinson disease (PD) and related synucleinopathies have been proposed to be combined proteinopathies and lipidopathies. Evidence strongly supports a physiological and pathogenic interplay between the disease-associated protein α-synuclein and lipids, with a demonstrable role for lipids in modulating PD phenotypes in the brain. Here, we refine this hypothesis by proposing PD to be a disease specifically involving metabolic dysregulation of fatty acids, a 'fatty acidopathy'. We review extensive findings from many laboratories supporting the perspective that PD centres on fatty acid dyshomeostasis - alterations in the fatty acid-ome - as the critical feature of lipid aberration in PD and other α-synucleinopathies. This construct places transient α-synuclein binding to fatty acid side chains of cytoplasmic vesicles as a principal contributor to the biology of PD-relevant α-synuclein-membrane interactions. We propose that α-synuclein-fatty acid interactions in the fatty acid-rich brain are interdependent determinants of the gradual progression from neuronal health to PD, with attendant therapeutic implications.

Here, we report updated long-term survival outcomes and biomarker analyses. Among 468 patients treated with QL1706 (5 mg/kg), median progression-free survival (mPFS) and overall survival (mOS) are 1.5 and 14.2 months for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), 1.9 and 20.2 months for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), and 4.2 and 18.6 months for cervical cancer (CC), respectively. Liver metastasis is correlated with poor progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in NSCLC and poor OS in CC, while elevated lactate dehydrogenase is linked to shorter PFS and OS in NPC. CDK4/11q13 diploid or the expression of GZMK(high) & MYC(low) distinguishes NPCs with the most favorable PFS. In NSCLC, PD-L1(+)/TIL(+) or a low ARG1:CXCL13 ratio indicates better outcomes. QL1706 offers long-term survival benefits in solid tumors, with identified molecular markers aiding in selecting suitable candidates.

However, the molecular identity of such ""wound signals"" and their receptors on nociceptors remains unknown. In Drosophila larvae, class IV dendritic arborization neurons are multimodal nociceptors that detect harsh touch, heat, and UV light to initiate nociceptive behavior. Here, we identify Vulnusin (from vulnus, a Latin word for wound), an endogenous peptide likely serving as a wound signal. Vulnusin, derived from the larval epidermis, activates PPK1/PPK26 ion channels expressed endogenously on nociceptors and heterologously in Drosophila S2 cells. Moreover, Vulnusin acts together with PPK1/PPK26 to trigger puncture-induced rolling behavior, a response to mechanical injury. These findings establish Vulnusin as a ligand that activates larval nociceptors and mediates mechanical-injury-induced nociception."	Neuron	03/10/2025

10.1001/jamapediatrics.2025.4091	Reevaluating Nonoperative Management for Pediatric Uncomplicated Acute	Faria I, Cintra ACG, de Oliveira LGAM, Squizzato F, Maia AS, Cunha AG, Radhakrishnan RS	IMPORTANCE: Nonoperative management (NOM) has emerged as a potential alternative to surgery for acute uncomplicated appendicitis in children; however, while short-term outcomes are often favorable, concerns remain about treatment durability, complication rates, and long-term failure. An updated meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) may help clarify the comparative safety and effectiveness of NOM vs appendectomy. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of NOM compared with appendectomy for uncomplicated appendicitis in children using the highest level of available evidence. DATA SOURCES: A systematic review of PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Cochrane, and Web of Science was conducted from inception through March 2025 to identify randomized clinical trials comparing NOM with surgical management in pediatric patients. STUDY SELECTION: RCTs comparing NOM vs surgical management in pediatric patients younger than 18 years were included. Nonrandomized and quasi-randomized studies were excluded. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Data were extracted following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Meta-analyses were conducted using random-effects models. Risk of bias was assessed independently by multiple reviewers. Trial sequential analysis was performed to determine whether the evidence was sufficiently robust and conclusive. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcomes were treatment failure and treatment success in 1 year and major complications (Clavien-Dindo grade ≥IIIb). Secondary outcomes included time to return to school and time to return to normal activity. RESULTS: Of 1246 studies screened, 7 RCTs, including 1480 pediatric patients, met inclusion criteria. Treatment failure was significantly higher in the NOM group than in the appendectomy group at 1 year (risk ratio [RR], 4.97; 95% CI, 3.57-6.91; I2 = 0.0%). Treatment success was significantly lower in the NOM group at 1 year (RR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.60-0.75; I2 = 31.1%). Major complications classified as Clavien-Dindo grade IIIb or worse were more frequent in the NOM group (RR, 33.37; 95% CI, 7.89-141.05; I2 = 9.5%). Appendicitis recurred at a rate of 18.47 events/100 observations (95% CI, 12.62-25.07 events/100 observations; I2 = 48.5%) among patients who received NOM. NOM, compared with appendectomy, was associated with a modestly faster return to school (mean difference, -1.36 days; 95% CI, -2.64 to -0.08 days; P = .04; I2 = 57.7%) and return to normal activities (-4.93 days; 95% CI, -8.68 to -1.19 days; P = .01; I2 = 87.2%), although this may be offset by subsequent readmissions or reintervention. Trial sequential analysis demonstrated the robustness and conclusiveness of primary outcomes. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In contrast to earlier studies, this meta-analysis found significantly higher treatment failure and major complication rates within a year with NOM among children and adolescents. The meta-analysis provides pediatricians and pediatric surgeons with up-to-date data to inform shared decision-making with families and encourage individualized, patient-centered treatment.

In Japan, single-unit umbilical cord blood transplantation (UCBT) has been widely used in the last two decades, whereas HCT from HLA-haploidentical related donors (haplo-HCT) has been increasingly used following the advent of posttransplant cyclophosphamide (PTCY) for graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis. This registry-based study aimed to compare outcomes between single-unit UCBT (n = 848) and PTCY-based haplo-HCT (n = 241) performed during first complete remission in patients with acute myeloid leukemia. UCBT was associated with a lower likelihood of engraftment (P < 0.001), a higher risk of grade 2-4 and grade 3-4 acute GVHD (P = 0.003 each), and a lower risk of extensive chronic GVHD (P = 0.048). The UCBT and haplo-HCT groups did not significantly differ in 3-year probabilities of overall survival (68% versus 69%, P = 0.686), GVHD/relapse-free survival (55% versus 54%, P = 0.866), relapse (14% versus 16%, P = 0.463), and non-relapse mortality (21% versus 19%, P = 0.403), respectively, which were confirmed with multivariate analysis. These results indicate that both procedures should be considered viable options for patients lacking a matched donor.	Bone marrow transplantation	05/10/2025
10.1001/jamaoncol.2025.3760	The Definition of Cure in Colon Cancer: A Pooled Analysis of 15 Randomized	Pastorino A, Liu H, Pederson L, Martelli V, Iveson T, de Gramont A, Alberts SR, George TJ, Yothers G, Harkin A, Labianca R, Taieb J, Schmoll HJ, Twelves C, Wolmark N, Saltz LB, Souglakos I, Goldberg RM, Kerr R, Lonardi S, Yoshino T, Puccini A, André T, Shi Q, Sobrero A	IMPORTANCE: The definition of cure in stage II to III colon cancer (CC) remains unclear due to limitations in conventional end points, which include deaths and second primary tumors as events. These can complicate communication with patients regarding long-term outcomes. OBJECTIVE: To distinguish relapses from competing health-related events to classify long-term outcomes years after surgery and explore when the incidence of true relapses of the initial CC approaches 0% to define cure in this disease. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This pooled analysis of individual patient-level data from 15 phase 3 randomized clinical trials assessed time to CC-related relapse using Kaplan-Meier and Aalen-Johansen methods, with death and second primary tumors treated as competing risks. Cox regression models evaluated prognostic associations, stratified by sex, stage, and tumor. Patients with stage II to III CC who underwent adjuvant chemotherapy were included. All patients had undergone radical surgery for CC and received adjuvant chemotherapy with a median follow-up of at least 6 years. The Adjuvant Colon Cancer Endpoints (ACCENT) and the International Duration Evaluation of Adjuvant Chemotherapy (IDEA) databases included adjuvant studies conducted between 1996 and 2015. Data were analyzed from February 2022 to June 2025. EXPOSURES: Adjuvant chemotherapy regimens varied across trials, including fluoropyrimidines alone or in combination with oxaliplatin or biologic agents. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was time to CC-related recurrence. The predefined threshold for cure was a recurrence risk below 0.5%. RESULTS: Of 35 213 included patients, 19 346 (54.9%) were male, and the mean (SD) age was 60.2 (10.8) years. The incidence rate of recurrence peaked at 6.4% (1993 of 31 373) between month 6 and month 12 and decreased continuously until year 10 of follow-up never exceeding 0.5%. Recurrence rate appeared to increase again after year 10 and peaked at 2.0% during year 12.5 to year 13, a pattern observed exclusively in the MOSAIC trial. Competing-event analysis revealed that death and second primary tumors inflated the apparent recurrence rate, especially for older patients. The overall cumulative incidence of relapse with death as competing risk was lower among female patients (hazard ratio, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.45-0.76; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this pooled analysis of phase 3 randomized clinical trials, a recurrence rate less than 0.5% occurred after 6 years from surgery, supporting a practical definition of cure. Recognizing this milestone may improve patient communication, guide follow-up duration, and reduce unnecessary long-term surveillance.	JAMA oncology	02/10/2025
10.1038/s43587-025-00968-1	ZDHHC11-mediated palmitoylation alleviates chondrocyte senescence and serves as a	Wang K, He W, Gong Z, Gao J, Gao T, Pan N, Wu D, Yang Y, Li Z, Zhao X, Ji M, Shen S	Osteoarthritis (OA) is a whole-joint disorder that interferes with the quality of life in older individuals. Here we report that ZDHHC11 is highly expressed in articular chondrocytes but is downregulated in the degenerated cartilage of aged mice and patients with OA. ZDHHC11 prevents chondrocyte senescence and promotes cartilage anabolism, culminating in an improved OA phenotype. The deletion of Zdhhc11 in mice (Zdhhc11(fl/fl)) exacerbates OA progression in a destabilized medial meniscus model. Specifically, we identify ZDHHC11 as a key palmitoyltransferase whose depletion leads to a GNB2-dependent E3 ubiquitin ligase-mediated proteasomal degradation of APOD. Mechanistically, ZDHHC11-mediated palmitoylation alleviates OA progression by deactivating the GATA4-P65 signaling pathway. We also propose an original lipid nanoparticle-based platform for Zdhhc11 mRNA delivery to rejuvenate impaired cartilage by specifically targeting chondrocytes in vivo. Collectively, ZDHHC11-dependent palmitoylation is essential for ameliorating OA, and the targeted delivery of ZDHHC11 may serve as a promising strategy for future OA treatment.

This study is aimed at analyzing the meat content of cattle meatballs and detecting foreign objects using ultrasonography (USG), digital radiography (DR), and electrical impedance tomography (EIT). Meatballs were produced using four different meat formulations (0%, 25%, 50%, and 75% meat) and three treatments (no preservative (control), borax, and formalin preservatives). Cast iron and plastic beads were used as models of foreign objects embedded in the samples. The echogenicity, opacity, and resistivity values of each sample were evaluated and compared across groups. The results showed that the shelf life of the control meatballs was shorter than that of meatballs with preservatives. The echogenicity and opacity values for the different meat formulations were hypoechoic in USG and grey in DR. USG was able to distinguish between control and preservative-treated meatballs but could not differentiate meat content and detect foreign objects. Conversely, DR effectively assessed meat content and detected iron-based foreign objects, while EIT showed higher resistivity values for iron and plastic beads compared to the meatball bodies.

10.1126/scitranslmed.adp3378	Genetic and structural aspects of amyloid diseases.	Rosenberg GM, Murray KA, Sawaya MR, Jiang YX, Geschwind DH, Eisenberg DS	The conversion of proteins into insoluble fibrillar aggregates known as amyloid occurs in a wide variety of diseases, e.g., Alzheimer's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, systemic transthyretin amyloidosis, and multisystem atrophy. There are more than 60 disease-associated amyloid-forming proteins, and amyloid formation can occur sporadically or can be induced or accelerated by genetic mutations. This Review discusses structural mechanisms by which genetic changes promote amyloid formation and thereby influence disease outcomes. By dividing amyloid-forming proteins into six types according to the genetic mutations they carry and analyzing mutation-induced structural changes in amyloid fibrils, a better understanding of inheritance patterns of amyloid diseases (amyloidoses) can be obtained.

10.1016/j.bcp.2025.117376	Cancer-associated transporters: Molecular drivers and drug delivery gateways.	Khan A, Biswas S, Garg M, Sengupta S	Membrane transporters are critical regulators of cellular homeostasis, mediating the uptake and efflux of nutrients, ions, and drugs. In cancer, their expression is frequently reprogrammed to support enhanced growth, survival, metabolic rewiring, invasiveness, and therapy resistance. Among these several solute carrier (SLC) transporters such as glucose transporters (GLUTs), monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs), and the sodium/iodine symporter (NIS) also facilitate selective delivery of radiopharmaceuticals, making them attractive therapeutic targets. The tumor suppressor p53 known for its central role in genome stability and apoptosis, also regulates a broad spectrum of membrane transporters. However, oncogenic mutations or structural conversion into amyloids can disrupt this regulatory network, leading to altered transporter expression and multidrug resistance. Despite growing interest, the transcriptional and post-transcriptional control of transporters by wt, mutant, and amyloid forms of p53 remains underexplored. In this review, we systematically characterize the p53-mediated regulation of diverse transporter classes involved in the transport of sugar, amino acids, metal ions, lipids along with ABC transporter functions and multidrug resistance. We highlight how cancer cells exploit transporters such as P-glycoprotein (P-gp), LAT1, GLUT1, MCTs, and NIS for metabolic advantage and survival. We also examine therapeutic strategies aimed at modulating transporter function using CRISPR/Cas9, small-molecule inhibitors, siRNA, and nanoparticle-based co-delivery systems. In particular, LAT1 inhibition demonstrates potential to starve tumors of essential nutrients. Ultimately, we propose that dual targeting of p53 aberrations and membrane transporters through synthetic biology and precision delivery approaches could restore chemosensitivity and suppress tumor progression, offering promising avenues for personalized cancer therapy.

To study drug resistance in patients, we developed CloneSeq-SV, which combines single-cell whole-genome sequencing(2) with targeted deep sequencing of clone-specific genomic structural variants in time-series cell-free DNA. CloneSeq-SV exploits tumour clone-specific structural variants as highly sensitive endogenous cell-free DNA markers, enabling the relative abundance measurements and evolutionary analysis of co-existing clonal populations over the therapeutic time course. Here, using this approach, we studied 18 patients with HGSOC over a multi-year period from diagnosis to recurrence and showed that drug resistance typically arose from selective expansion of a single or small subset of clones present at diagnosis. Drug-resistant clones frequently showed interpretable and distinctive genomic features, including chromothripsis, whole-genome doubling, and high-level amplifications of oncogenes such as CCNE1, RAB25, MYC and NOTCH3. Phenotypic analysis of matched single-cell RNA sequencing data(3) indicated pre-existing and clone-specific transcriptional states such as upregulation of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and VEGF pathways, linked to drug resistance. In one notable case, clone-specific ERBB2 amplification affected the efficacy of a secondary targeted therapy with a positive patient outcome. Together, our findings indicate that drug-resistant states in HGSOC pre-exist at diagnosis, leading to positive selection and reduced clonal complexity at relapse. We suggest these findings motivate investigation of evolution-informed adaptive treatment regimens to ablate drug resistance in future HGSOC studies.	Nature	01/10/2025
10.1186/s12943-025-02439-y	P23 acts as a negative regulator of ferroptosis in NSCLC by blocking GPX4	Chen J, Peng Y, Zhou M, Che Y, Zhao S, He C, Zhang W, Tian X, Zhang W, Liu Z, Zhou M, Liang G, Huo X, Wang Y, Yu Z, Ma X	Ferroptosis has been identified as a tumor-inhibiting event in a variety of cancers; however, its molecular basis in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has not been completely elucidated. Notably, glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) plays a crucial role in ferroptosis. Our previous research revealed that prostaglandin E synthase 3 (p23), a potential transcription factor, plays a crucial role in promoting cancer progression and metastasis through succinylation. Our study revealed a previously unknown antiferroptotic function of p23. Mechanistically, p23 stabilizes GPX4 by competitively binding heat shock cognate 71 kDa protein (HSC70) to suppress chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) activity, which subsequently inhibits ferroptosis and accelerates tumor growth. Notably, impairing p23 succinylation disrupts its interaction with HSC70, restoring	Molecular cancer	02/10/2025

Yet, how and when this is achieved remains uncertain. Using a murine sarcoma model with fluorescent neoantigens, we found that tumors developed later and in fewer T cell-sufficient mice (∼53% penetrance) than T cell-deficient mice (∼100%). With T cells, all emergent tumor cells had silenced neoantigens, but neoantigen-negative tumor cells were also present in every T cell-deficient mouse. This suggested silencing was necessary but not sufficient for outgrowth. Genetic removal of neoantigens restored tumor penetrance if implemented on day 5 post-tumor initiation, but not day 10, because CD8(+) and CD4(+) T cells infiltrated the tissue and eliminated most neoantigen-positive and -negative tumor cells within 8 days. Single-cell analyses on day-7 tumors showed oncogenic changes including increased proliferation and T cell-dependent upregulation of the IFNγ-response gene Cd274 (PD-L1). T cell-depletion rescued both neoantigen-positive and -negative cells, while IFNγ blockade rescued only negative cells. This shows that T cells efficiently edit sarcomas of neoantigens and prevent early tumors via IFNγ-independent and IFNγ-dependent (bystander) mechanisms.	Cancer cell	02/10/2025

We uncover a direct role of EZH2 histone methyltransferase in promoting CIN in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Across breast cancers, EZH2 expression correlates with copy number alterations, and its catalytic activity is associated with increased CIN in metastasis-initiating cells. Pharmacological EZH2 inhibition suppressed CIN, revealing an unexpected vulnerability. Integrated chromatin and transcriptome profiling identified Tankyrase (TNKS), a poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, as a direct transcriptional target of EZH2. Mechanistically, EZH2-mediated TNKS suppression disrupts CPAP (centrosomal P4.1-associated protein), driving centrosome overduplication, multipolar mitosis and exacerbated CIN. In vivo, CIN suppression is a critical mechanism underlying the anti-metastatic effects of EZH2 inhibition. These findings delineate a previously unrecognized epigenetic mechanism governing CIN and establish EZH2 inhibitors as the first therapeutic agents capable of directly suppressing CIN, underscoring the need for trials with metastasis-focused endpoints.

10.1186/s13098-025-01947-7	C-reactive protein-triglyceride glucose index predicts mortality in	Ying Q, He F, Wu L, Wei Q, Xu J	BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic (CKM) syndrome is defined by the interplay of metabolic risk factors, chronic kidney disease, and cardiovascular disease. The C-reactive protein-triglyceride glucose index (CTI) is a composite biomarker that reflects both inflammation and insulin resistance, but whether it is associated with mortality in persons with early-stage CKM syndrome is unknown. METHODS: We analyzed data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey from 1999 to 2010. We used multivariable Cox proportional-hazards models to assess the association between the CTI score and the risk of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality, with vital status ascertained through Linkage to the National Death Index through December 31, 2019. RESULTS: Among 10,718 participants, a total of 1783 deaths (491 from CVD) occurred during a mean follow-up of 14.0 years. In fully adjusted models, a higher CTI score was associated with a greater risk of all-cause mortality (HR per unit increase, 1.56; 95% CI, 1.36 to 1.78) and of CVD mortality (HR per unit increase, 2.03; 95% CI, 1.49 to 2.77). The association with all-cause mortality was stronger among participants under the age of 60 than among those over 60 years old (P < 0.001 for interaction). CONCLUSION: Our study found that in patients with early-stage CKM syndrome, a higher CTI was independently associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality and CVD mortality. This association was more significant in younger participants.	Diabetology & metabolic syndrome	03/10/2025

However, most patients eventually experience disease progression and optimal second-line strategies after atezo-bev failure remain unclear. Prospective evidence supporting multikinase inhibitors in this context is limited. METHODS: This investigator-initiated, multicenter, single-arm study (KCSG HB23-04) enrolled 50 patients with uHCC who progressed after first-line atezo-bev across 13 sites between August 2023 and May 2024. Patients received second-line lenvatinib at 12 mg or 8 mg daily, depending on body weight, until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival. Secondary endpoints were overall survival, objective response rate, disease control rate, duration of response, and safety. RESULTS: Of the 50 patients enrolled, the median age was 66 years, and 72% had a viral etiology. The median time to progression with atezo-bev was 6.5 months. During a median follow-up of 12.6 months, the median progression-free survival was 5.4 months (95% CI 4.2-7.1) (>4.5 months), meeting the prespecified primary endpoint. Median overall survival was 9.8 months (95% CI 8.1-NR). The objective response rate was 14.0%, and the disease control rate was 82.0%. The median duration of response was 9.4 months. Survival outcomes were different according to the objective response with lenvatinib, but not by time to progression on atezo-bev or HCC etiology. The most common adverse events were diarrhea (42.0%), hypothyroidism (32.0%), and anorexia (30.0%). Grade ≥3 adverse events occurred in 46.0% of patients. CONCLUSIONS: Lenvatinib demonstrated promising efficacy and a manageable safety profile as a second-line treatment for patients with HCC progressing on atezo-bev. These findings offer prospective evidence supporting lenvatinib as a viable treatment option in the post-atezo-bev context. IMPACT AND IMPLICATIONS: This study provides the first prospective evidence for the use of lenvatinib as a second-line therapy for patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma who have progressed after first-line atezo-bev treatment. The findings highlight the potential of lenvatinib as a viable therapeutic option in a clinical setting where few alternatives are available. The results are particularly important for healthcare professionals managing unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma, as they provide a robust framework for considering lenvatinib in second-line treatment protocols. Given the manageable safety profile, these findings could be translated into practical recommendations for clinical practice, offering physicians a treatment strategy to improve patient outcomes following atezo-bev failure while guiding future research into combination therapies and broader patient populations.

10.1007/s13577-025-01294-9	Elucidating the risk factors and oncogene drivers of acute myeloid leukemia.	Sanya DRA, Onésime D	The hematopoietic system is critical for maintaining physiological homeostasis but is also implicated in various pathologies. The magnitude of hematopoietic responses to perturbations or diseases exhibits significant inter-individual variability, underscoring the need to identify predictors and determinants of blood responsiveness in humans. These reactions are shaped not only by genetic factors but also by epigenetic modifications and environmental effects. Elucidating baseline predictors of hematopoietic responses and their molecular underpinnings is of particular interest in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), given their potential to inform malignancy immunotherapy. Due to limited understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms driving diverse AML subtypes in pediatric and adult patients, coupled with an increasing prevalence of refractory or relapsed hematological malignancies, this review highlights underexplored prognostic biomarkers, their molecular mechanisms, and their potential clinical utility in optimizing therapeutic strategies for improved patient survival. It examines recent advances in AML research and vaccine development, focusing on efforts to address highly aggressive and rare AML subtypes driven by aberrantly activated transcription factors. The review also addresses clinical implications for overall survival and treatment response, as well as promising vaccine candidates. Additionally, it highlights newly identified mutations and high-risk molecular markers that could enhance risk stratification for early disease progression, identifying patients who may benefit from allogeneic stem cell transplantation or enrollment in clinical trials.

We aimed to assess the status of pathological response reporting in renal cell carcinoma and develop a recommendation on tissue preparation and response reporting for neoadjuvant treatment. We conducted a systematic review of publications on the PubMed and Web of Science databases to identify manuscripts reporting response to pre-surgical therapy in renal cell carcinoma. 119 eligible papers were identified. Only five (4%) studies included details of how pathological response had been assessed. Qualitative statements on residual tumour were common (55 [46%] studies), but only eight (7%) studies used a quantitative assessment of pathological response. Guidelines for tissue preparation and pathological response reporting were reviewed at an international workshop held at the Netherlands Cancer Institute in October, 2024, and further developed through expert discussions. To assess neoadjuvant pathological response, nephrectomy specimens should be sampled with the use of a standardised baseline approach with consideration for more extensive sampling. Microscopic assessment should quantify the residual viable tumour in 10% intervals and greatest linear extent. Clinical details, including the neoadjuvant therapy received, should accompany the pathological assessment. In this systematic review, we describe a standardised method for assessment and reporting pathological response, initially intended for use in clinical trials or research settings. These guidelines will help investigators to assess whether the degree of pathological response is linked to survival outcomes and will inform future standard reporting practices.	The Lancet.

Li J, Liu C, Zhang P, Shen L, Qi C	Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy is revolutionizing the management of haematological malignancies but faces particular hurdles in the treatment of solid tumours. In this Review, we discuss important advances in refining CAR T cell therapy to provide practical clinical insights to address these challenges. We describe key strategies, including target antigen selection to enhance efficacy while minimizing on-target, off-tumour toxicities; early apheresis, rapid manufacturing and frontline application to preserve T cell fitness and ensure timely treatment; lymphodepletion to augment CAR T cell expansion; locoregional delivery to maximize local therapeutic concentrations and reduce systemic toxicity; and repeat infusions to prolong therapeutic effects. Furthermore, we discuss advanced response evaluation frameworks that will be essential for accurate assessment of the efficacy of CAR T cell therapies, and we highlight the need for robust toxicity management approaches to mitigate severe adverse events. By systematically addressing these multifaceted challenges, this Review provides a comprehensive guide for the optimization of CAR T cell therapy for solid tumours to enhance both efficacy and safety.

Prevalence for reported (13/217, 5.99%) and cumulative predicted (24/217, 11.06%) variants of significance (11 genes) falls below that reported for non-Africans. Conversely, BRCA1, HOXB13, CDK12, MLH1, MSH2, and BRIP1 remain unimpacted. Through pathogenic ranking based on variant frequency and functionality, clinical presentation and tumour-matched biallelic inactivation, top-ranked candidates include PREX2, POLE, FAT1, BRCA2, POLQ, LRP1B and ATM. Besides notable impact of DNA polymerases, including POLG, Fanconi anaemia genes include FANCD2, FANCA, FANCG, ERCC4, FANCE and FANCI, while DNA mismatch repair genes MSH3 and PMS1 outranked known namesakes MSH6 and PMS2.

Even today, researchers debate if morphological alterations in the brain are linked to MDD, likely due to the heterogeneity of this disorder. The application of deep learning tools to neuroimaging data, capable of capturing complex non-linear patterns, has the potential to provide diagnostic and predictive biomarkers for MDD. However, previous attempts to demarcate MDD patients and healthy controls (HC) based on segmented cortical features via linear machine learning approaches have reported low accuracies. In this study, we used globally representative data from the ENIGMA-MDD working group containing 7012 participants from 31 sites (N = 2772 MDD and N = 4240 HC), which allows a comprehensive analysis with generalizable results. Based on the hypothesis that integration of vertex-wise cortical features can improve classification performance, we evaluated the classification of a DenseNet and a Support Vector Machine (SVM), with the expectation that the former would outperform the latter. As we analyzed a multi-site sample, we additionally applied the ComBat harmonization tool to remove potential nuisance effects of site. We found that both classifiers exhibited close to chance performance (balanced accuracy DenseNet: 51%; SVM: 53%), when estimated on unseen sites. Slightly higher classification performance (balanced accuracy DenseNet: 58%; SVM: 55%) was found when the cross-validation folds contained subjects from all sites, indicating site effect. In conclusion, the integration of vertex-wise morphometric features and the use of the non-linear classifier did not lead to the differentiability between MDD and HC. Our results support the notion that MDD classification on this combination of features and classifiers is unfeasible. Future studies are needed to determine whether more sophisticated integration of information from other MRI modalities such as fMRI and DWI will lead to a higher performance in this diagnostic task.

However, the generalizability of these findings to real-world settings remains uncertain. AIM: This study aimed to evaluate the real-world cardiovascular effectiveness of sustained GLP1-RA use compared to dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitor (DPP-4i) over 3.5 years. METHODS: Using Danish nationwide registries, we emulated a target trial to assess the real-world effectiveness of GLP1-RAs in a population of individuals with type 2 diabetes mirroring the inclusion and exclusion criteria from the Liraglutide Effect and Action in Diabetes: Evaluation of Cardiovascular Outcome Results (LEADER) trial. The study period was 2012-2022. Outcomes included the composite of myocardial infarction, stroke, and cardiovascular mortality (3P-MACE), as well as each component individually, alongside all-cause mortality, heart failure, angina pectoris, and revascularization. Longitudinal Targeted Minimum Loss-based Estimation, a method that adjusts for both baseline and time-varying confounding, was used to estimate absolute risks of cardiovascular outcomes under sustained use of GLP1-RA and DPP 4i (active comparator), adjusting for baseline and time-varying confounding.

10.1016/j.tibs.2025.09.001	Mitochondrial dynamics and pore formation in regulated cell death pathways.	Hohorst L, Ros U, Garcia-Saez AJ	Mitochondria act as central hubs for cell death signaling. During apoptosis and regulated necrosis (pyroptosis, necroptosis, and ferroptosis), mitochondria undergo drastic changes including membrane permeabilization, fragmentation, and loss of membrane potential. However, dissection of the mechanisms underlying these processes is challenging because they involve remodeling of mitochondrial membranes coupled to the assembly of protein complexes whose dynamics are difficult to capture. We discuss progress in our understanding of mitochondrial alterations in cell death and highlight state-of-the-art experimental approaches to study them. We focus on advanced single-molecule and correlative microscopy methods which have recently provided unprecedented details about the dynamics and structure of protein complexes in mitochondria and their impact on membrane organization.

Published studies to date indicate 2 recurrent mutations, D801N and E815K, and a more severe phenotype in the E815K cohort. We performed mutation analysis and retrospective genotype-phenotype correlations in all eligible patients with AHC enrolled in the US AHC Foundation registry from 1997-2012. Clinical data were abstracted from standardized caregivers' questionnaires and medical records and confirmed by expert clinicians. We identified ATP1A3 mutations by Sanger and whole genome sequencing, and compared phenotypes within and between 4 groups of subjects, those with D801N, E815K, other ATP1A3 or no ATP1A3 mutations. We identified heterozygous ATP1A3 mutations in 154 of 187 (82%) AHC patients. Of 34 unique mutations, 31 (91%) are missense, and 16 (47%) had not been previously reported. Concordant with prior studies, more than 2/3 of all mutations are clusteredin exons 17 and 18. Of 143 simplex occurrences, 58 had D801N (40%), 38 had E815K(26%) and 11 had G947R (8%) mutations [corrected].Patients with an E815K mutation demonstrate an earlier age of onset, more severe motor impairment and a higher prevalence of status epilepticus. This study further expands the number and spectrum of ATP1A3 mutations associated with AHC and confirms a more deleterious effect of the E815K mutation on selected neurologic outcomes. However, the complexity of the disorder and the extensive phenotypic variability among subgroups merits caution and emphasizes the need for further studies.	PloS one	01/01/2015

The ROME trial was a multicenter, randomized, open-label phase 2 study comparing tailored treatment (TT) to standard of care (SoC) in patients with advanced solid tumors progressing after one or two lines of therapy. Comprehensive genomic profiling on tissue and blood was performed to identify actionable alterations. Overall response rate (ORR) was the primary endpoint, and progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), time to treatment failure (TTF), time to next treatment (TTNT) and safety were the secondary endpoints. Between November 2020 and August 2023, 1,794 patients were screened, 897 were evaluated by the molecular tumor board (MTB) and 400 were randomized to TT or SoC. TT achieved a significantly higher ORR (17.5% versus 10%; P = 0.0294) and improved median PFS (3.5 months versus 2.8 months; hazard ratio = 0.66 (0.53-0.82), P = 0.0002). TT also showed superior 12-month PFS rates (22.0% versus 8.3%). Median OS was similar, with a 52% crossover rate. Grade 3/4 adverse events were also similar (40% TT versus 52% SoC). These results highlight the potential of TT to improve outcomes for patients with diverse actionable genomic alterations. These results also provide relevant evidence supporting a tumor-agnostic precision oncology strategy and highlight the potential of TTs, guided by genomic profiling and MTB recommendations, to significantly improve outcomes for patients with diverse actionable genomic alterations.

10.1186/s12943-025-02467-8	Non-coding RNAs in gastric cancer: mechanisms and therapeutic prospects.	Han Z, Liu W, Zhu Y, Sun Y, Sun D, Jia R, Yang Y, Qi H, Zhang L, Huo Y, Zhang N, Chai J, Yang M	Gastric cancer is the fifth most common cancer and the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. It is associated with high molecular and phenotypic heterogeneity. Early-stage gastric cancer can be treated with endoscopic resection and surgery, whereas at its advanced stage, sequential chemotherapy presents the only treatment option, which starts with first-line platinum and fluoropyrimidine-based dual drugs, supporting a median survival period of less than one year. Targeted monoclonal antibodies approved for the treatment of gastric cancer are effective for a limited subset of patients. Furthermore, painless and precise markers for the early detection of gastric cancer and new targets for its treatment are unavailable. Interestingly, many non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), such as microRNAs (miRNAs), long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), and circular RNAs (circRNAs), play key roles in the development of gastric cancer. Multiple pieces of evidence suggest that ncRNAs play a crucial role in the treatment of gastric cancer using chemotherapy and targeted therapy drugs. In this article, we systematically reviewed the important roles of ncRNAs in chemotherapy resistance, immune escape, metabolism, and angiogenesis of gastric cancer, and systematically elucidated the relevant molecular mechanisms. In addition, we also proposed the potential clinical significance of ncRNA as a new therapeutic target and prognostic biomarker for gastric cancer.	Molecular cancer	03/10/2025

OBJECTIVE: To estimate the cost-utility and cost-effectiveness of accelerated KRT initiation compared with standard KRT initiation in critically ill patients with AKI. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this economic evaluation, a state-transition model was developed using data from the Standard vs Accelerated Initiation of Renal Replacement Therapy in AKI (STARRT-AKI) trial, a multicenter, multinational randomized clinical trial of critically ill patients with severe AKI conducted between October 2015 and September 2019. Trial data were linked to administrative health databases in Alberta, Canada, to estimate costs and long-term clinical outcomes. The model included 4 health states: no chronic kidney disease, severe chronic kidney disease, KRT dependent, and dead. Costs are reported in 2024 Canadian dollars. Data were analyzed from February 2022 to November 2024. EXPOSURE: Initiation of KRT. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome for the economic evaluation was cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. The QALY is a combined measure of patient quality of life and length of life. Expected costs, QALYs, incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), and incremental net monetary benefit (INMB) were estimated on the basis of 5000 Monte Carlo simulations. RESULTS: A total of 146 patients from the STARRT-AKI trial were included in the analysis, with 73 patients (mean [SD] age, 59.67 [14.5] years; 52 men [71.3%]) randomized to receive accelerated initiation and 73 patients (mean [SD] age, 61.88 [12.9] years; 48 men [65.8%]) randomized to receive standard initiation. Standard initiation was more costly per patient than accelerated initiation (mean [SD], $251 370 [$155 801] vs $231 518 [$183 302]) but generated more QALYs (mean [SD] 7.49 [2.03] QALYs vs 6.64 [1.76] QALYs). The ICER of standard initiation compared with accelerated initiation was $23 208, with an INMB of $22 648 (95% credible interval, $15 980-$29 316) when assuming a willingness to pay per QALY of $50 000. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The findings of this economic evaluation suggest that standard KRT initiation may be cost-effective in a Canadian setting, but this finding was sensitive to postdischarge cost trajectories and regional variation in KRT dependence.

10.1136/gutjnl-2025-335412	Current and emerging concepts for systemic treatment of metastatic colorectal	Steup C, Kennel K, Neurath MF, Fichtner-Feigl S, Greten F	Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common malignant cancers and its incidence is steadily rising particularly in young patients. While screening measures and the widespread availability of surgical treatment have led to an impressive improvement of prognosis within the overall CRC population, patients with metastatic CRC still face 5-year survival rates of around 10-25%. Despite continuous development of new systemic treatment strategies that include cytotoxic chemotherapy and targeted therapy, most patients with metastatic CRC eventually progress. However, a small proportion of patients with mismatch repair-deficient or microsatellite unstable CRC responds exceptionally well to treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors, thereby proving that CRC is in principle amenable to immunotherapy and showing that long-term disease stabilisation can be achieved even in metastasised stages. However, the reasons for the lack of response to immunotherapy in the vast majority of CRC cases remain to be elucidated. Yet, recent evidence suggests that the tumour stroma, which includes non-immune cells in the colorectal tumour microenvironment, mediates immunosuppressive mechanisms that prevent effective immunotherapy. These findings open new avenues for the development of advanced immunotherapies for CRC. In this review, we summarise major developments in the systemic therapy of CRC within the last couple of decades, provide an overview of emerging and soon-to-be implemented therapeutic strategies and present concepts from clinical and preclinical research to manipulate tumour cells and the tumour stroma to sensitise microsatellite stable colorectal tumours to immunotherapy.

10.1053/j.seminhematol.2025.08.003	The immunotherapy landscape in AML: Defining knowledge gaps toward rational	Subklewe M, Rutella S, Curti A	Immunotherapy has dramatically improved outcomes in lymphoid malignancies. In B cell cancers, CD19-directed CAR T cells and T-cell engagers have produced high remission rates and durable responses, now forming the cornerstone of treatment in many relapsed or refractory settings. In contrast, acute myeloid leukemia (AML) has not experienced a comparable breakthrough. To date, only antibody-drug conjugates have reached regulatory approval, with gemtuzumab ozogamicin approved in combination with intensive induction and consolidation therapy for newly diagnosed CD33-positive AML. This divergence is rooted in the biological and immunologic complexity of AML. Unlike B-cell malignancies with lineage-restricted surface markers such as CD19, AML lacks leukemia-specific antigens. Most targets are shared with normal hematopoietic progenitors, leading to on-target/off-leukemia toxicity. Moreover, AML exerts local and systemic immunosuppression through both tumor-intrinsic and microenvironmental mechanisms, limiting T-cell persistence and function. This review will introduce the current immunotherapy platforms under investigation in AML, starting with antibody-based approaches, followed by T-cell redirecting therapies, and culminating in an overview of immune resistance, the bone marrow microenvironment, and strategies toward personalized combinatorial immunotherapy. By synthesizing recent clinical data and mechanistic insights, including those from early CAR and T-cell engager trials, we aim to provide a translational framework for how immunotherapy might still reshape AML care-through integration of immune contexture of the bone marrow environment aiming for rational combinatorial approaches.

10.1016/j.canlet.2025.218072	Targeting the FBXO5-DOK6 Axis to Overcome Temozolomide Resistance in Glioblastoma	Wang C, Wang M, Zhu Z, Tan H, Su D, Qiao M, Jiang M, Che F	The development of resistance to temozolomide (TMZ) represents a critical challenge in the management of glioblastoma (GBM), yet the molecular basis for this resistance is still not fully elucidated. In this study, we utilized a custom-designed CRISPR/Cas9 sgRNA library that targets 1,117 genes associated with ubiquitination, combined with a positive-negative dual screening strategy, to identify pivotal factors in TMZ resistance. This approach revealed F-Box Protein 5 (FBXO5), an E3 ligase subunit, as a major contributor to TMZ resistance. Correlation analyses indicated that high levels of FBXO5 are associated with poor treatment response and reduced survival in GBM patients. Further investigation showed that FBXO5 promotes K48-linked polyubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal breakdown of DOK6, a protein whose depletion enhances mechanical rigidity in tumor cells and initiates survival signaling. Additionally, through virtual screening of a natural product library containing 4,500 compounds, we identified Theaflavin 3,3'-digallate (TF3) as a selective inhibitor of FBXO5. This compound was found to synergistically improve TMZ sensitivity both in vitro and in vivo. Our results highlight a critical proteasome-cytomechanics pathway in GBM chemoresistance and suggest that targeting FBXO5 could be an effective therapeutic strategy for treating patients with GBM.

However, it is unclear whether this could reflect missed clinical diagnoses or subthreshold nonoptimal risk factor exposure preceding CHD, and whether similar patterns are observed for heart failure (HF) or stroke. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to determine the antecedent occurrence of nonoptimal levels of 4 traditional risk factors (blood pressure [BP], cholesterol, glucose, and tobacco smoking) before first CHD, HF, or stroke. METHODS: We analyzed 2 population-based prospective cohorts: KNHIS (Korean National Health Insurance Service) (n = 9,341,100; baseline age ≥20 years; follow-up, 2009-2022) and MESA (Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis) (n = 6,803; baseline age 45-84 years; follow-up, 2000-2019). Among individuals who developed incident CHD, HF, or stroke during follow-up, we determined the prevalence of ≥1 traditional risk factor above optimal level-systolic BP ≥120 mm Hg or diastolic BP ≥80 mm Hg or BP-lowering treatment; total cholesterol ≥200 mg/dL or lipid-lowering treatment; fasting glucose ≥100 mg/dL or diagnosis of diabetes or glucose-lowering treatment; or past or current smoking-at any visit before CVD. RESULTS: Analyses were based on 601,025 and 1,188 CVD events in KNHIS and MESA, respectively. Prevalence of ≥1 nonoptimal risk factor was high (99.7% and 99.6%) before CHD, with similar patterns before HF (99.4% and 99.5%) and stroke (99.3% and 99.5%) in both KNHIS and MESA, respectively. Prevalence of ≥1 risk factor before CVD was consistently high (>99%) across age groups in both men and women, with the lowest proportion observed for HF and stroke (>95%) when occurring at ages <60 years in women. Prevalence of ≥2 risk factors was also common (93.2% to 97.2%) before CVD events. CONCLUSIONS: In this binational study of 2 prospective cohorts, the presence of nonoptimal levels of ≥1 traditional risk factor was nearly universal before CVD. These results not only challenge claims that CHD events frequently occur without antecedent major risk factors but also demonstrate that other CVD events, including HF or stroke, rarely occur in the absence of nonoptimal traditional risk factors, highlighting the importance of primordial prevention efforts.

10.1038/s41467-025-63987-x	Bacterial RNA promotes proteostasis through inter-tissue communication in C.	Kyriakakis E, Medde C, Ritz D, Fucile G, Schmidt A, Spang A	Life expectancy has been increasing over the last decades, which is not matched by an increase in healthspan. Besides genetic composition, environmental and nutritional factors influence both health- and lifespan. Diet is thought to be a major factor for healthy ageing. Here, we show that dietary RNA species improve proteostasis in C. elegans. Inherent bacterial-derived double stranded RNA reduces protein aggregation in a C. elegans muscle proteostasis model. This beneficial effect depends on low levels of systemic selective autophagy, the RNAi machinery in the germline, even when the RNA is delivered through ingestion in the intestine and the integrity of muscle cells. Our data suggest a requirement of inter-organ communication between the intestine, the germline and muscles. Our results demonstrate that bacterial-derived RNAs elicit a systemic response in C. elegans, which protects the animal from protein aggregation during ageing, which might extend healthspan.

This study aimed to explore BaP's tumorigenic mechanisms in GBM through an integrated approach combining network toxicology, single-cell transcriptomics, Mendelian randomization, and bibliometric analysis. METHODS: BaP target genes were predicted using ChEMBL, SEA, and PharmMapper, and GBM-related genes were retrieved from GeneCards, OMIM, and TTD. Overlapping genes were used to construct a protein-protein interaction network in Cytoscape. Molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations were performed to assess BaP-target interactions. Single-cell RNA-seq data (GSE131928) were analyzed to profile gene expression in GBM subpopulations. Mendelian randomization assessed causal relationships between core genes and GBM risk, and findings were validated in vitro. Bibliometric analysis tracked research trends on these genes. RESULTS: 31 overlapping genes were identified. TP53 was highly expressed in MES-like and AC-like malignant cells as well as CD8⁺ Tex cells. MR revealed a significant inverse association between TP53 expression and GBM risk (OR = 0.13, 95 % CI: 0.04-0.47, p = 0.002). Docking and simulation showed strong BaP-TP53 binding, confirmed by in vitro experiments. Bibliometrics indicated that TP53 research in GBM has shifted from basic mechanisms to clinical translation. CONCLUSION: BaP may drive GBM by targeting TP53, offering insights for GBM prevention and therapy.	Ecotoxicology and environmental safety	01/10/2025
10.1038/s41397-025-00384-z	Serine-arginine protein kinase 1 (SRPK1) is under-expressed in mucinous	Duggan WP, Azimi M, Flanagan L, Sullivan GP, Reynolds IS, Fay J, Dussmann H, Ní Chonghaile T, Sheehan KM, Jirström K, Prehn JHM, Burke JP	5-15% of all colorectal cancers (CRCs) are mucinous. Mucinous CRCs are associated with an inhibited response to standard adjuvant and neoadjuvant therapies. Serine-Arginine Protein Kinase 1 (SRPK1) is an enzyme, which modulates the activity of multiple splicing factors. SRPK1 under-expression is associated with resistance to platinum-based chemotherapeutic agents in multiple tumor types. The objectives of this study were to evaluate SRPK1 expression in mucinous CRC and to explore the potential relationship between differential SRPK1 expression and oxaliplatin resistance in mucinous CRC. Rectal cancer and CRC Tissue Microarrays (TMA) were stained with SRPK1 to compare expression between mucinous and non-mucinous tumors. SRPK1 expression was analyzed in mucinous and non-mucinous CRC cell lines. Cells were treated with oxaliplatin to explore differences in treatment response. Mucinous cells were transfected with an SRPK1 CRISPR/Cas9 lentiviral activation plasmid to investigate the relationship between SRPK1 expression and oxaliplatin resistance. The TMA cohorts included 117 patients with mucinous and 441 patients with non-mucinous CRC. SRPK1 was found to be under-expressed in both the mucinous rectal cancer (P < 0.001) and CRC cohorts (P = 0.003). On univariate analysis, SRPK1 under-expression was found to be associated with worse 5-year OS (P = 0.001). Treatment of mucinous CRC cells with oxaliplatin did not result in a significant increase in cell death (P = 0.149). However overexpression of SRPK1 following transfection with a CRISPR/CAS9 activation plasmid resulted in a significant increase in sensitivity of these cells to oxaliplatin treatment (P = 0.029). SRPK1 is under-expressed in mucinous CRC, and under-expression is associated with worse OS. This may be due to the positive effects of SRPK1 on oxaliplatin sensitivity.

Proteomics offers a crucial approach to elucidating AD pathogenesis, as alterations in protein expression are more directly linked to phenotypic outcomes than changes at the genetic or transcriptomic level. In this study, we develop multiscale proteomic network models for AD by integrating large-scale matched proteomic and genetic data from brain regions vulnerable to the disease. These models reveal detailed protein interaction structures and identify putative key driver proteins (KDPs) involved in AD progression. Notably, the network analysis uncovers an	Cell	25/09/2025

This limits our understanding of the mechanisms underlying hematogenous dissemination, especially in early breast cancer (BC), where CTCs are rare. Here, we aimed to detect CTCs with different EMT statuses from BC patients. CTCs in blood samples from 107 BC patients were evaluated using immunomagnetic depletion and multi-marker immunofluorescence (EpCAM, E-cadherin, MCAM, cell surface vimentin, CD31, CD45), followed by single-cell transcriptomics. CTCs were detected in 51.9% of therapy-naïve early BC cases, with 3.8% showing only epithelial CTCs (eCTCs), 5.8% epithelial-mesenchymal (emCTCs), 26.0% mesenchymal (mCTCs), and 16.3% mixed phenotypes. CTC heterogeneity was more frequent in triple-negative (86%) than in luminal BC (17%, P = 0.008). Lymph node involvement strongly predicted dissemination of all CTC phenotypes, while tumor size correlated with mCTC abundance. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed downregulation of ribosomal genes and translation inhibition in CTCs with mesenchymal features, linked to mTORC1 signaling. Findings were also validated in an independent dataset, highlighting vulnerabilities in CTCs during dissemination.	Molecular oncology	05/10/2025
10.1186/s13148-025-01976-z	Exploring causal relationships between epigenetic age acceleration and	Liu H, Yin Z, Chen X, Wang Z	BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is identified by a distinct progression of aging-associated cognitive and functional impairment. Recent advances recognize the DNA methylation-based epigenetic clock as a precise predictor of aging processes and their related health outcomes. However, observational studies exploring this link are often compromised by confounding factors and reverse causality bias. To address the question, our study employs a bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to explore the causal relationship between epigenetic age acceleration (EAA) and AD. METHODS: Genome-wide association study (GWAS) statistics for epigenetic clocks (GrimAge, PhenoAge, HorvathAge, and HannumAge) were sourced from Edinburgh DataShare and the Alzheimer Disease Genetics Consortium (ADGC). The dataset comprised 63,926 participants, and among them, 21,982 cases were AD patients and 41,944 were controls. The primary analytical method for the MR was the inverse variance weighted (IVW). The potential pleiotropy and heterogeneity among the instrumental variables were evaluated by additional sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: Employing the random-effects IVW approach, we found that, as indicated by GrimAge, EAA was associated with an increased risk of AD (Odds Ratio [OR] = 1.025, 95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 1.006-1.044, p = 0.009). Quality control assessments confirmed the reliability and robustness of our findings. However, the evidence did not support a causal relationship between AD and epigenetic aging in the reverse direction. CONCLUSIONS: Our MR study indicates a positive causal relationship between EAA and AD. Further research is necessary to explore the underlying physiological mechanisms.

Over 163 sequence variants have been associated with IBD in genome-wide association studies, but they have weak effects and explain only a fraction of the observed heritability. It is expected that additional variants contribute to the genomic architecture of IBD, possibly including rare variants with effect sizes larger than the identified common variants. Here we applied a family study design and sequenced 38 individuals from five families, under the hypothesis that families with multiple IBD-affected individuals harbor one or more risk variants that (i) are shared among affected family members, (ii) are rare and (iii) have substantial effect on disease development. Our analysis revealed not only novel candidate risk variants but also high polygenic risk scores for common known risk variants in four out of the five families. Functional analysis of our top novel variant in the remaining family, a rare missense mutation in the ubiquitin ligase TRIM11, suggests that it leads to increased nuclear factor of kappa light chain enhancer in B-cells (NF-κB) signaling. We conclude that an accumulation of common weak-effect variants accounts for the high incidence of IBD in most, but not all families we analyzed and that a family study design can identify novel rare variants conferring risk for IBD with potentially large effect size, such as the TRIM11 p.H414Y mutation.

However, the role of the 3D chromatin architecture in regulating VSMC identity remains elusive. A genome-scale CRISPR screen identifies LEMD3 as a potential regulator to maintain VSMC identity. Lemd3 deficiency in VSMCs results in the loss of the contractile phenotype and exacerbates intimal hyperplasia in mice. Protein interactome analysis reveals that LEMD3 interacts with CBX3, a principal reader of H3K9me2/3, subsequently anchoring heterochromatin at the nuclear periphery. Employing the DNA polymer model based on Hi-C data, whole-chromosome simulations demonstrate that Lemd3 depletion disturbs the chromatin structure. Multi-omics analysis further reveals that Lemd3 depletion alters the genome conformation as the increase of inter-TAD (topologically associated domain) interactions at the boundaries of A and B compartments, which correlates with decreased chromatin accessibility and repressed expression of VSMC contractile genes. This study reveals that LEMD3 organizes the 3D chromatin architecture by anchoring heterochromatin at the nuclear periphery to maintain the VSMC contractile identity.	Nature communications	03/10/2025

Here we unveil the role of microtubules in mechanosignalling, operating downstream of subnuclear F-actin and nuclear envelope mechanics. Upon mechanical activation, microtubules reorganize from a perinuclear cage into a radial array nucleated by centrosomes. This structural rearrangement triggers degradation of AMOT proteins, which we identify as key mechanical rheostats that sequester YAP/TAZ in the cytoplasm. AMOT is stable in mechano-OFF but degraded in mechano-ON cell states, where microtubules allow AMOT rapid transport to the pericentrosomal proteasome in complex with dynein/dynactin. This process ensures swift control of YAP/TAZ function in response to changes in cell mechanics, with experimental loss of AMOT proteins rendering cells insensitive to mechanical modulations. Ras/RTK oncogenes promote YAP/TAZ-dependent tumorigenesis by corrupting this AMOT-centred mechanical checkpoint. Notably, the Hippo pathway fine-tunes mechanotransduction: LATS kinases phosphorylate AMOT, shielding it from degradation, thereby indirectly restraining YAP/TAZ. Thus, AMOT protein stability serves as a hub linking cytoskeletal reorganization and Hippo signalling to YAP/TAZ mechanosignalling.	Nature cell biology	01/10/2025
e315	Influence of Pokémon Go on Physical Activity: Study and Implications.	Althoff T, White RW, Horvitz E	BACKGROUND: Physical activity helps people maintain a healthy weight and reduces the risk for several chronic diseases. Although this knowledge is widely recognized, adults and children in many countries around the world do not get recommended amounts of physical activity. Although many interventions are found to be ineffective at increasing physical activity or reaching inactive populations, there have been anecdotal reports of increased physical activity due to novel mobile games that embed game play in the physical world. The most recent and salient example of such a game is Pokémon Go, which has reportedly reached tens of millions of users in the United States and worldwide. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to quantify the impact of Pokémon Go on physical activity. METHODS: We study the effect of Pokémon Go on physical activity through a combination of signals from large-scale corpora of wearable sensor data and search engine logs for 32,000 Microsoft Band users over a period of 3 months. Pokémon Go players are identified through search engine queries and physical activity is measured through accelerometers. RESULTS: We find that Pokémon Go leads to significant increases in physical activity over a period of 30 days, with particularly engaged users (ie, those making multiple search queries for details about game usage) increasing their activity by 1473 steps a day on average, a more than 25% increase compared with their prior activity level (P<.001). In the short time span of the study, we estimate that Pokémon Go has added a total of 144 billion steps to US physical activity. Furthermore, Pokémon Go has been able to increase physical activity across men and women of all ages, weight status, and prior activity levels showing this form of game leads to increases in physical activity with significant implications for public health. In particular, we find that Pokémon Go is able to reach low activity populations, whereas all 4 leading mobile health apps studied in this work largely draw from an already very active population. CONCLUSIONS: Mobile apps combining game play with physical activity lead to substantial short-term activity increases and, in contrast to many existing interventions and mobile health apps, have the potential to reach activity-poor populations. Future studies are needed to investigate potential long-term effects of these applications.	Journal of medical Internet research	06/12/2016

To date, the field is limited to utilizing a few of the over 600 human E3 ligases. To expand this repertoire, we conducted structural and functional validation of DDB1 (Damage-specific DNA binding protein 1) and Cullin-associated factor (DCAF)2 (DTL/CDT2), a Cullin4-RING ligase substrate adaptor implicated in DNA damage response and cancer, as a novel E3 for TPD. Cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of the DCAF2:DDB1:DDA1 complex (3.3 Å), a ligand bound complex (3.1 Å), and a ternary complex with a covalent proteolysis-targeting chimera (PROTAC) and BRD4 (3.4 Å) reveal PROTAC-mediated substrate recruitment. Using covalent bifunctional tool compounds engaging residue C141 in the WD40 domain, we demonstrate robust ubiquitination in biochemical assays and cellular TPD using the COFFEE (covalent functionalization followed by E3 electroporation) method. These findings position DCAF2 as a promising E3 adaptor for PROTAC strategies and identify C141 as a relevant site for future PROTAC discovery.	Structure (London, England : 1993)	03/10/2025

Here, we demonstrate the presence of pseudo-synaptic connections between sensory nerve endings and cancer cells in an extracerebral cancer, i.e., pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). These synaptic sites exhibit a selective enrichment of the glutamatergic N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDA) receptor subunit NMDAR2D (GRIN2D) on the cancer cells, which turns PDAC cells responsive to neuron-derived glutamate and promotes tumor growth and spread. Intriguingly, neurons transform a subset of co-cultured PDAC cells into calcium-responsive cells via GRIN2D-type glutamate receptors at the neuron-cancer pseudo-synapses. We found that the expression of this subunit is due to the increased glutamate availability provided by sensory innervation in a neurotrophic feedforward loop. Moreover, interference with the glutamate-GRIN2D signaling at these neuron-cancer pseudo-synapses markedly improved survival in vivo. This discovery of peripheral cancer-neuron pseudo-synapses may provide an opportunity for cancer-neuroscience-instructed oncological therapies.	Cancer cell	25/09/2025
10.2967/jnumed.125.270190	Multicentric Matched-Pair Analysis of Long-Term Hematotoxicity of Peptide	Steinhelfer L, Jungmann F, Endroes L, Lanzafame H, Hermann K, Pfob CH, Lapa C, Hartrampf PE, Dörrler AL, Buck AK, Götze K, Wenzel P, Geisler F, Walter R, Haneder E, Lohöfer F, Haller B, Braren R, Eiber M	Peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) with (177)Lu-DOTATATE is an approved treatment for metastatic neuroendocrine tumors (NETs). Although the therapy is effective, hematologic toxicity, particularly leukopenia, remains a significant concern. The spleen, which accumulates radiolabeled somatostatin analogs, may play a critical role in modulating this toxicity. This study investigates whether patients undergoing PRRT after splenectomy exhibit lower hematologic toxicity. Methods: This multicenter retrospective study included 68 patients with metastatic NETs treated with PRRT between 2009 and 2022. Splenectomized patients (n = 34) were matched to nonsplenectomized patients on the basis of age, sex, tumor location, grading, metastatic pattern, and treatment cycles. Hematologic parameters (leukocytes, lymphocytes, neutrophils, hemoglobin, and platelets) were assessed at baseline and 12 and 24 mo after PRRT. Hematotoxicity was graded using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events. Statistical analyses included t test, Mann-Whitney U test, and Fisher exact test, with an α of 0.05 and Bonferroni adjustment applied. Results: Splenectomized patients had significantly lower rates of leukopenia, with a mean decline of 12.8% in leukocyte count at 24 mo versus 47.2% in nonsplenectomized patients (P < 0.001), and a higher median absolute leukocyte count (7.2 vs. 4.2 × 10³/mm³, P < 0.001). Leukopenia occurred in 2 splenectomized patients compared with 20 in the control group (P < 0.001). Lymphocyte decline was also less pronounced, with higher absolute counts at 24 mo. Platelet counts were consistently higher postsplenectomy, although relative changes over time were not significant. Neutrophil counts and hemoglobin levels remained comparable between groups. Conclusion: Splenectomy appears to reduce leukopenia and improve hematologic tolerability in NET patients undergoing PRRT, highlighting the spleen's role in leukocyte regulation. These patients may better tolerate intensified PRRT regimens, including additional cycles or reinduction, with minimal toxicity. This is particularly relevant for patients with pancreatic NETs, who frequently undergo splenectomy and face a poorer prognosis. Prospective studies are needed to further clarify the spleen's impact on PRRT-related hematotoxicity and guide treatment optimization.

We aimed to evaluate the combination of an immune checkpoint inhibitor with platinum-based therapy in this population. METHODS: This open-label, single-arm phase 2 NEJ045A trial enrolled untreated patients with extensive-stage SCLC with performance status 2 or 3. Participants received four cycles of durvalumab, carboplatin, and etoposide, followed by durvalumab maintenance. A dose adjustment strategy was used, with initial reductions in carboplatin-etoposide dosages, subsequently adjusted based on adverse events, allowing for potential escalation. The primary endpoint was tolerability, assessed by the proportion of patients completing induction therapy. A key secondary endpoint was 1-year survival rate. This trial is registered at the Japan Registry of Clinical Trials (jRCTs031200319) and has been completed. FINDINGS: Between April 8, 2021, and Oct 3, 2023, 57 patients (performance status 2 n=43 and performance status 3 n=14) were enrolled with a median age of 73·5 years (IQR 69·0-77·5), 44 (79%) of 56 were male. 26 (67%; 80% CI 55·2-76·7; p<0·0001) of 39 patients with performance status 2 and five (50%; 26·7-73·3; p=0·0088) of ten with performance status 3 completed induction therapy, exceeding the pre-specified threshold. Grade 3 or higher adverse events occurred in 52 (93%) of 56 patients, and 12 (21%) of 56 discontinued due to adverse events. The 1-year survival rates were 43·4% (80% CI 34·1-53·1) overall (p<0·0001), 50·0% (39·1-60·9) in performance status 2 (p<0·0001), and 18·2% (5·0-41·5) in performance status 3. INTERPRETATION: Durvalumab, carboplatin, and etoposide showed tolerability and promising efficacy as a first-line treatment for patients with untreated extensive-stage SCLC with poor performance status, supporting the integration of immune checkpoint inhibitors in this therapeutically challenging population.

Here, we show that cadaverine shapes monocyte-macrophage immunometabolism in a context- and concentration-dependent fashion to impact macrophage functionality. At baseline, cadaverine is taken up via L-lysine transporters and activates the thioredoxin system, while during inflammation, cadaverine signals through aconitate decarboxylase 1 (Acod1)-itaconate. Both pathways induce activation of transcription factor, nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), which supports mitochondrial respiration and promotes immunoregulatory macrophage polarization. Conversely, under higher concentrations, cadaverine acts via histamine 4 receptor, leading to glycolysis-driven inflammation and pro-inflammatory functions in macrophages. Likewise, cadaverine exhibits paradoxical effects in experimental colitis, either protective or detrimental, evoking opposite fates on macrophages depending on levels dictated by Enterobacteriaceae. In IBD patients, elevated cadaverine correlated with higher flare risk. Our findings implicate cadaverine as a microbiota-derived metabolite manipulating macrophage energy metabolism with consequences in intestinal inflammation and implications for IBD pathogenesis.

This study seeks to examine the relationship between the neutrophil percentage-to-albumin ratio (NPAR) and the likelihood of developing RA-related OP(RA-OP). METHODS: After investigating the relationship between the NPAR and RA-OP in the clinical retrospective study, we further validated this association using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) database (2005-2020 cycles). This retrospective study enrolled 718 RA patients from the Rheumatology Department of the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine between January 2020 and December 2024. Patients were categorized into low-NPAR (<1.7598) and high-NPAR (≥1.7598) groups based on the median NPAR. Extracted clinical data encompassed demographic characteristics, comorbidities, serological markers, and other laboratory parameters. Preliminary univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses assessed potential associations between NPAR and RA-OP, multi-model adjusted logistic regression was subsequently applied to evaluate the independent association, subgroup analyses examined consistency across demographic and clinical strata, Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis assessed NPAR's diagnostic performance, and then Restricted cubic splines (RCS) visualized potential non-linear relationships. Finally using the identical statistical framework, we validated findings within the NHANES cohort. RESULTS: The high-NPAR group exhibited significantly higher OP incidence than the low-NPAR group (39.0% vs. 26.5%; P<0.001). After full adjustment (Model 4), NPAR remained independently associated with increased RA-OP risk as a categorical variable (high vs. low NPAR: adjusted OR = 1.70 (95%CI: 1.01~2.88); P = 0.049). Subgroup analyses demonstrated no significant interaction effects (P-interaction>0.05) except for disease duration. The ROC curve showed an Area Under the Curve(AUC) of 0.58 (95%CI: 0.53~0.63) and NPAR cut-off of 1.886. The covariate-adjusted RCS indicated a linear dose-response relationship (P overall=0.033; P nonlinearity=0.168). NHANES cohort analysis independently validated both the NPAR-RA-OP association and its linear characteristic. CONCLUSION: NPAR, serving as a novel composite biomarker integrating neutrophil-mediated inflammation and nutritional status (via albumin), independently predicts OP risk in RA. Its derivation from routine clinical parameters renders NPAR a readily deployable, cost-effective tool for OP risk stratification in clinical practice.	Frontiers in immunology	01/01/2025

Here we developed a Tau-clearing cell therapy based on monocytes functionalized with a high-affinity Tau-specific aptamer. The aptamer was covalently conjugated to the surface of monocytes (derived from bone marrow leucocytes and cultured under monocyte-inducing conditions) via bioorthogonal chemistry without affecting their viability or function. Upon intravenous administration in mice expressing mutant and disease-relevant human Tau, the engineered monocytes actively crossed the blood-brain barrier and accumulated in Tau-rich brain regions such as the hippocampus and striatum. They efficiently phagocytosed extracellular Tau, leading to a significant reduction in Tau burden. As a result, glial activation was suppressed, neuroinflammation was alleviated, and neuronal and mitochondrial integrity was preserved. Long-term treatment improved memory and spatial learning, without inducing toxicity or behavioural side effects. These results demonstrate that aptamer-guided monocytes can achieve targeted delivery, effective clearance and sustained neuroprotection, offering a promising strategy for therapeutic intervention in Alzheimer's disease.

However, they still experience physiological decline, and different studies have linked frailty to this population. Exercise interventions reverse frailty and improve functional capacity, but no studies have addressed the effect of an intervention in centenarians. In this study, we assessed the impact of a 12-week resistance exercise intervention in a group of centenarians and characterized their functional capacity as well as the expression of several molecular biomarkers associated with frailty. METHODS: A total of 19 centenarians were enrolled, but 7 of them did not complete the study. The remaining 12 centenarians were randomly assigned to the control or intervention group, which was a 12-week resistance exercise intervention. Molecular biomarkers were measured by qRT-PCR and ELISA. RESULTS: The intervention group improved their functional capacity measured by Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) (post 5.0 vs 2.3 in pre) and Physical Performance and Mobility Examination (PPME) (6.5 vs 3.8), as well as in frailty status studied by Fried Frailty Phenotype (3.0 vs 3.8) and Frailty Trait Scale 5 (FTS5) (post 30.7 vs 34.0 in pre) scales. ANCOVA revealed that the resistance training led to significant improvements in functional capacity scales SPPB (p = 0.01) and PPME (p < 0.001), as well as Fried Frailty Phenotype (p = 0.001) and FTS5 (p = 0.05). Biomarkers related to frailty (EGR1, miR194-5p, miR125b-5p and miR454-3p) and inflammation (IL-6 and IL-1β) showed different expression patterns in centenarians (n = 19) compared to both old (n = 44, average of 79 years old) and young adults (n = 34, average of 29 years old) groups. Notably, the intervention was associated with improvements in frailty and inflammation biomarkers expression. Finally, correlation analyses showed significant associations between all functional and frailty variables, with SPPB correlating with miR454-3p (ρ = 0.73) and FTS5 correlating with miR454-3p (ρ = -0.83), IL-6 (ρ = 0.60) and miR125b-5p (ρ = -0.55).

10.1002/oby.70058	Reasons for Discontinuation of Obesity Pharmacotherapy With Semaglutide or	Gasoyan H, Butsch WS, Casacchia NJ, Schulte R, Criswell V, Fox J, Renner H, Le P, Alpert J, Rothberg MB	OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to characterize the reasons for treatment discontinuation with injectable semaglutide or tirzepatide for obesity in regular clinical practice. METHODS: This cross-sectional study used electronic health record data between January 2022 and December 2024 from a single integrated health system in Ohio and Florida. The primary reason for treatment discontinuation was examined in a randomly selected sample of adults with overweight or obesity and without type 2 diabetes who initiated injectable semaglutide or tirzepatide and discontinued treatment within the first year. RESULTS: We randomly selected 288 patients; 145 received semaglutide and 143 tirzepatide. Overall, 137 patients (47.6%) discontinued their medication due to cost or insurance-related issues, 42 (14.6%) due to inability to tolerate the side effects, 34 (11.8%) as they were unable to fill the medication due to shortages, 7 (2.4%) as they switched to a compounded medication, and 5 (1.7%) due to unsatisfactory weight loss; 31 (10.8%) discontinued for other reasons, and for 32 (11.1%) patients the discontinuation reason was not specified in the electronic health record. CONCLUSIONS: High cost or insurance-related issues are the most common reasons for treatment discontinuation with semaglutide or tirzepatide for obesity. Our findings highlight the need for policies to address cost and could inform discussions between healthcare providers and patients concerning cost and side effects.

10.1038/s41467-025-63942-w	Mitotic DNA repair by TMEJ suppresses replication stress-induced nuclear envelope	Ye G, He Y, Zhang Y, Li D, Liu F, Li Y, Ge Q, Guo Q, Han S, Song C, Chang W, Zhang H, Peng Q, Sun K, Ji W, Deng L	Replication stress (RS), if not effectively and timely addressed, could result in DNA damage in mitosis. However, the relationship between RS and other mitotic events, such as nuclear envelope (NE) breakdown and reassembly, remains poorly understood. Here we report that RS can lead to NE defect. Importantly, rather than de novo NE rupture, the defect per se is a result of nuclear envelope reassembly defect (NERD) during mitosis. Interestingly, NERD is associated with mitotic DNA damage, and repair of the damage by DNA polymerase theta (Polθ)-mediated end joining (TMEJ) ameliorates NERD. Genomic mapping of lamina associated domains (LADs) by cleavage under targets and tagmentation (CUT&Tag) identifies a population of replication stress-sensitive LADs (RESSLADs). Strikingly, a substantial portion of RESSLADs reside in the common fragile sites (CFSs). The loss of RESSLADs-NE interaction under RS might be attributed to the sustained phosphorylation of Lamin A/C at the sites of NERD. In addition, prominent NE defect is observed under multiple conditions of synthetic lethality. Altogether, these findings establish a link between genome instability and nuclear vulnerability under replication stress.	Nature communications	03/10/2025
10.1016/j.ajcnut.2025.06.019	Ultraprocessed foods consumption, inflammatory index levels, and risk of suicide	Wu Y, Sun M, Yuan Y, Zhang S, Zhu L, Lou Z, Shi Y, Li J, Sun Z, Yang L, Li L, Shen Y	BACKGROUND: Suicide attempts (SAs) are a major public health issue, with many cases being preventable. However, the impact of dietary patterns remains inadequately studied. Currently, the rising consumption of ultraprocessed foods (UPFs) has been linked to various health issues, including mental health disorders that may increase risk of SA. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to investigate the association between UPF consumption and SA, and explore the mediating role of SA-related inflammatory index levels. METHODS: This study included 208,938 participants from the UK Biobank cohort, recruited from 2006 to 2010. Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess the association between the weight proportion of UPF intake and incident SA. Substitution analyses were conducted to evaluate risk of SA when replacing UPF with unprocessed or minimally processed foods (UNPFs). Causal mediation analyses were further conducted to estimate the mediating effects of inflammatory index levels in this association. RESULTS: Over a median follow-up of 13.1 y, 545 SA events were identified. Compared with participants in the lowest quintile of UPF consumption, those in the highest quintile had a 1.63 times higher risk of developing SA [hazard ratio (HR): 1.63, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.23, 2.15]. Additionally, each SD increase in UPF consumption was associated with a 20% higher risk of SA (HR: 1.20, 95% CI: 1.11, 1.29). Notably, replacing 20% of UPF weight with UNPF was linked to a 23% reduction in SA risk (HR: 0.77, 95% CI: 0.69, 0.85). Furthermore, in causal mediation analyses, inflammatory index levels mediated 0.7%-1.5% of the association between UPF consumption and SA. CONCLUSIONS: Higher UPF consumption is associated with an increased risk of SA, partially mediated by inflammatory index levels. Replacing UPF with UNPF significantly reduces SA incidence, highlighting potential benefits of transitioning to a diet with higher UNPF consumption.

For decades, auxin has been proposed to promote PIN polarization, generating self-regulatory feedback mediating much of plant development, but mechanistic insight into this regulation is lacking. Here, we uncover an auxin-induced protein complex at the PM, containing auxin co-receptors transmembrane kinases (TMKs) and PIN1 auxin exporter, as the core machinery that underlies this feedback regulation. Auxin promotes PIN1 phosphorylation by TMKs, modulating PIN1 polarization and transport activity. We also provide evidence that PIN1-exported extracellular auxin is crucial for TMK activation and cell elongation, thus forming the simplest two-element self-regulatory feedback circuit. Thus, these findings offer direct mechanistic insights into a potential self-organizing circuit for auxin signaling and transport to ensure proper plant development in Arabidopsis.

Preclinical data suggest that inflammatory cytokines activated by PM2.5 affected EGFRm clone expansion. Here, we explored the correlation between inflammatory markers and EGFRm NSCLC. METHODS: Resected NSCLC patients (2016-2023) were enrolled. Tumor tissues and blood serum were retrieved from Ramathibodi tumor biobank. EGFR 19del and L858R mutations were performed by rt-PCR in cancerous tissue and dPCR in normal tissue in the same patient. NF-Kb and STAT3 protein signaling were measured by ELISA in both cancerous and normal tissue. Cytokines (IL-1ß, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12 and TNF-α) were explored in serum by flow cytometry. RESULTS: Among 140 patients, EGFRm prevalence was 58% in cancerous tissue but only 5% in normal tissue. NF-kB and STAT3 were statistically higher in cancerous tissue than normal tissue [NF-kB median O.D.=0.82 (IQR; 0.07-2.82) vs. 0.32 (IQR; 0.05-2.48), P < 0.001; STAT3 median O.D.=0.32 (IQR; 0.10-1.58) vs. 0.17 (IQR; 0.06-1.29, P < 0.001]. STAT3 was significantly increased in EGFRm compared to EGFRwt [median O.D.=0.36 (IQR; 0.234-0.592) vs. 0.23 (IQR; 0.158-0.409), OR = 11.09 (95% CI; 2.17-56.58), P = 0.004].

Here, we examined the hierarchy and functional consequences of cross-regulation between these factors. We identified two Blimp1-bound cis-regulatory elements, Tcf7(+22kb) and Tcf7(+17kb), that enforced Tcf7 silencing in a context-specific manner during both acute and chronic responses. Deletion of these elements decoupled Tcf7 repression from effector differentiation but did not rewire effector T cells to a memory state or prevent the acquisition of phenotypic hallmarks of exhaustion. However, combined ablation of Prdm1 and Tcf7 preserved a memory surface phenotype despite defects in secondary expansion. Thus, the anti-proliferative and pro-differentiative effects of Blimp1 in effector or exhausted CD8(+) T cells represent mechanistically distinct modules, wherein repression of Tcf7 limits proliferative capacity but not memory or progenitor specification.

In the ""ARTIC"" trial, we assessed the incidence of AbE in patients with progressive MM by evaluating the effect of RT on NILs. METHODS: ARTIC (Abscopal effects in metastasized cancer patients treated with RadioTherapy and Immune Checkpoint inhibition) (ARO (Arbeitsgemeinschaft Radiologische Onkologie) 2022-10, DRKS00032390) retrospectively screened clinical records of patients with stage IV MM with PD under ICI. Patients received RT for metastases and had ≥1 NIL outside the RT field (=control lesion). NILs were evaluated according to iRECIST (immune Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors): abscopal response (AR): size reduction ≥30%, abscopal progression (AP): size increase ≥20%, abscopal control (AC): all others. Patients with AR and/or AC were categorized as abscopal benefit (AB), patients with AP and/or mixed response=no AB. RT details and factors influencing AR were analyzed. RESULTS: After screening clinical records of 3773 patients with stage IV tumor from 12 oncological centers in Germany, we identified 47 patients with MM with 115 NILs. RT targeted metastases in brain (38.3%) and lung (19.1%), primarily using stereotactic RT (29.8%). The mean time interval between the end of ICI and RT was 3.53±5.67 months. AR was achieved in 19.1% of patients and 29.1% of lesions. Compared with stereotactic RT, normofractionated or other (non-stereotactic) RT regimens significantly reduced the probability of AB (OR=0.092, p=0.04, 95% CI: (0.007 to 0.758)).

Given the lack of direct comparative data, we conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis to guide treatment selection. METHODS: We developed a Markov decision analytic model to assess five treatments: RC, nadofaragene, nogapendekin, pembrolizumab, and gemcitabine/docetaxel. Cost effectiveness was evaluated over a 5-yr period using a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100 000 per quality-adjusted life year from the US Medicare perspective. Three index patients with BCG-unresponsive carcinoma in situ (CIS) were assessed. KEY FINDINGS AND LIMITATIONS: For index patient 1, who is willing to try one line of therapy or proceed directly to RC, gemcitabine/docetaxel was the most cost-effective option. For index patient 2, open to two lines of therapy or upfront RC, RC was most cost effective. For index patient 3, willing to try up to two lines of US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved therapy (pembrolizumab, nadofaragene, or nogapendekin) before RC, pembrolizumab was the most cost-effective option. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Current pricing of bladder-sparing treatments poses significant financial barriers for patients with BCG-unresponsive CIS. Gemcitabine/docetaxel is most cost effective when only one therapy line is considered before RC, although this varies by clinical scenario. Upfront RC is most cost effective for patients wanting to try up to two lines of therapy. For patients only willing to try FDA-approved options and unwilling to undergo upfront RC, pembrolizumab is the most cost-effective option. Our findings highlight the need for better treatment selection tools and more equitable pricing."	European urology	03/10/2025

We assessed the frequency of hypogammaglobulinemia in PwMS who previously received non-anti-CD20 DMTs and evaluated short-term Ig level changes after switching to rituximab (RTX) or ocrelizumab (OCR). This retrospective study included PwMS starting RTX or OCR, with or without prior DMT exposure. Patients were grouped as treatment-naïve or receiving fingolimod (FING), natalizumab (NTZ), or moderate-efficacy DMTs (interferons, glatiramer acetate, dimethyl fumarate, or teriflunomide) before the switch. Among 417 included patients, 89 were treatment-naïve, 207 had received FING, 70 NTZ, and 51 moderate-efficacy DMTs. Before switching, hypogammaglobulinemia (IgG level <7 ​g/L) was rare in treatment-naïve and moderate-efficacy DMT groups (2 ​%) but more frequent after FING (29 ​%) and NTZ (14 ​%) treatment. One year after initiating RTX/OCR, IgG level slightly decreased in treatment-naïve patients (p ​< ​0.05), remained stable in NTZ and moderate-efficacy DMT groups, and increased significantly in FING-treated patients (8.0-8.6 ​g/L, p ​< ​0.0001), with a decline in hypogammaglobulinemia prevalence (29 ​%-21.5 ​%). FING exposure was associated with frequent IgG hypogammaglobulinemia, but switching to RTX/OCR was not linked to a short-term decrease in IgG level; instead, it led to a significant increase in level. These findings support that hypogammaglobulinemia should not be an absolute contraindication to switching to RTX/OCR after FING discontinuation given their efficacy in preventing MS reactivation. A secondary de-escalation strategy may be considered based on individual risk profiles and IgG level trajectories.	Neurotherapeutics : the journal of the American Society for Experimental	04/10/2025
10.1016/j.ejphar.2025.178206	Statins activate temperature-gated transient receptor potential ion channels.	Oprita G, Domocos D, Selescu T, Paduraru A, Tunaru S, Leffler A, Babes A, Babes RM	Statins are HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors administered to decrease levels of LDL cholesterol and to lower the risk of cardiovascular disease. Although statins are relatively well tolerated, adverse effects such as myalgia and painful peripheral neuropathy have been reported. While the underlying cause has not been fully elucidated, accumulating evidence shows that statins have numerous pleiotropic effects including anti-inflammatory and analgesic actions in several animal pain models. Here we report that some of the most extensively used statins activate members of the temperature-gated transient receptor potential (TRP) ion channel subfamily expressed in heterologous systems. All tested statins (simvastatin, atorvastatin and rosuvastatin) activate human TRPA1 and, in addition, simvastatin activates human TRPV1 and rosuvastatin activates human TRPM8. The activation of TRPV1 by simvastatin is abolished in a capsaicin-insensitive mutant. Furthermore, the sensitivities of both TRPV1 and TRPA1 to simvastatin are diminished in triple cysteine mutants known to exhibit a reduced sensitivity to reactive oxygen species. Rosuvastatin-induced activation of TRPM8 seems to involve an aspartate residue which is essential for sensitivity to the synthetic TRPM8-agonist icilin. In mouse dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons, simvastatin activates a subpopulation of neurons which also respond to the TRPV1-agonist capsaicin or the TRPA1-agonist allyl isothiocyanate. In addition, TRPM8 plays an important role for the activation of a small population of DRG neurons by rosuvastatin. Taken together, these results indicate that statins activate thermo-sensitive TRP channels expressed in nociceptive sensory neurons. This property may explain some of the pleiotropic effects of these widely used drugs.	European journal of pharmacology	01/10/2025

The genetic factors contributing to susceptibility across different populations and tumour subsites remain incompletely understood. Here we show, through a genome-wide association and fine mapping study of over 19,000 HNSCC cases and 38,000 controls from multiple ancestries, 18 genetic risk variants and 11 signals from fine mapping of the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region, all previously unreported. rs78378222, a regulatory variant for TP53 is associated with a 40% reduction in overall HNSCC risk. We also identify gene-environment interactions, with BRCA2 and ADH1B variants showing effects modified by smoking and alcohol use. Subsite-specific analysis of the HLA region reveals distinct immune-related associations across HPV-positive and HPV-negative tumours. These findings refine the genetic architecture of HNSCC and highlight mechanisms linking inherited variation, immunity, and environmental exposures.	Nature communications	02/10/2025

To identify bacterial contributors to phenotypic diversity, we developed new RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and phylogenomic tools to capture hundreds of Mtb isolate transcriptomes, link transcriptional and genetic variation, and find associations between variants and epidemiologic traits. Across 274 Mtb clinical isolates, we uncovered unexpected diversity in virulence gene expression, which we linked to known and unknown regulators. Surprisingly, we found that many isolates harbor variants associated with decreased expression of EsxA (Esat6) and EsxB (Cfp10), which are virulence effectors, dominant T cell antigens, and immunodiagnostic targets. Across >55,000 isolates, these variants associate with increased transmissibility, especially in drug-resistant Mtb strains. Our data suggest expression of Mtb virulence genes is evolving in response to drug-linked pressure, raising concerns about use of these targets in immunodiagnostics and next-generation vaccines.

Many intracellular pathogens, including Plasmodium, exploit these raft-like structures to recognize and invade host cells. In particular, Plasmodium depends on host cholesterol to build its own membranes, as it is unable to perform sterol synthesis. Using quantitative proteomics, lipid analysis, and bioinformatics, this study defines the composition and dynamics of Plasmodium falciparum DRMs from key developmental stages: schizonts, which give rise to invasive merozoites, and gametocytes, which are responsible for transmission to the mosquito vector. Comparative analysis of the flotation properties of DRM-associated proteins and lipids reveals both conserved and stage-specific features in the structural organization of membrane microdomains. Following parasite invasion, host DRMs are also remodeled with the internalization of components of the erythrocyte junctional complex and their repositioning in the newly generated parasitophorous vacuole membrane. Prediction and analysis of the DRM interactomes reveals a core of proteins involved in fundamental biological processes maintained between the schizont and gametocyte stages. This common core forms a highly interconnected subnetwork that occupies a central position in the interactomes, while stage-specific functions occupy a peripheral position in the network.

Phages respond with counter-defences that deplete these second messengers, leading to an escalating arms race with the host. Here we outline an antiphage system we call Panoptes that indirectly detects phage infection when phage proteins antagonize the nucleotide-derived second-messenger pool. Panoptes is a two-gene operon, optSE, wherein OptS is predicted to synthesize a nucleotide-derived second messenger and OptE is predicted to bind that signal and drive effector-mediated defence. Crystal structures show that OptS is a minimal CRISPR polymerase (mCpol) domain, a version of the polymerase domain found in type III CRISPR systems (Cas10). OptS orthologues from two distinct Panoptes systems generated cyclic dinucleotide products, including 2',3'-cyclic diadenosine monophosphate (2',3'-c-di-AMP), which we showed were able to bind the soluble domain of the OptE transmembrane effector. Panoptes potently restricted phage replication, but phages that had loss-of-function mutations in anti-cyclic oligonucleotide-based antiphage signalling system (CBASS) protein 2 (Acb2) escaped defence. These findings were unexpected because Acb2 is a nucleotide 'sponge' that antagonizes second-messenger signalling. Our data support the idea that cyclic nucleotide sequestration by Acb2 releases OptE toxicity, thereby initiating inner membrane disruption, leading to phage defence. These data demonstrate a sophisticated immune strategy that bacteria use to guard their second-messenger pool and turn immune evasion against the virus.	Nature	01/10/2025

Chang Q, Chen L, Zhu Y, Liu B, Zhou X, Liang H, Lin F, Li D, Zhu Z, Pan Z, Chen X, Liu H, Sun D, Lv J, Li L, Pan P, Yu C, Zhang Y	BACKGROUND: Unhealthy lifestyle behaviors, leading to systemic metabolic disturbances, are significantly linked to the risk of late-onset asthma. However, the underlying metabolism-related mechanisms remain unclear. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to identify lifestyle-related metabolites and assess their predictive value for incident asthma. METHODS: Using NMR metabolomics data from the UK Biobank population (aged 40-69), plasma metabolites associated with healthy lifestyle scores were identified through multiple linear regression. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to further screen metabolites linked to late-onset asthma risk. Elastic net regularization selected critical metabolites for developing an asthma risk prediction model, incorporating conventional clinical characteristics and lifestyle factors. A metabolic score based on non-zero regularization coefficients was derived, and its association with asthma risk was evaluated through survival analysis. Models and metabolic score performance were validated in unused internal UK Biobank participants and an external China Kadoorie Biobank cohort. RESULTS: Among 198,607 participants (mean age 56.4 years), 159 plasma metabolites were significantly related to healthy lifestyle scores, 103 of which were associated with incident asthma risk. Nine metabolites were selected and incorporated into the asthma risk prediction model, significantly improving its predictive performance (Area under the curve: 0.812 vs. 0.758). Individuals with an unfavorable metabolic signature exhibited a 77.0% increased risk (hazard ratio [HR] 1.770, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.634-1.918) of developing asthma compared to those with a favorable metabolic signature, with a stronger effect observed in females (HR 1.914, 95% CI 1.729-2.118). The results for the predictive model and metabolic score were confirmed in both internal and external validations. CONCLUSION: Multiple lifestyle-related metabolites are associated with late-onset asthma risk and can help stratify asthma risk, particularly among females.

METHODS: This real-world study included 250 people with obesity and T1D (female = 54.8%), treated with either tirzepatide (n = 35), semaglutide (n = 36), liraglutide (n = 97) or usual care (n = 82). Secondary outcomes included changes in lipid profile, renal and liver markers, blood pressure, and HbA1c. RESULTS: All three agents led to significant weight loss. Tirzepatide showed the greatest reduction of weight loss (10.9%; p < 0.001), followed by semaglutide (9.9%; p < 0.001) and liraglutide (7.1%; p < 0.001). Dose-dependent reductions were observed for tirzepatide and semaglutide. Tirzepatide, semaglutide and liraglutide modestly reduced HbA1c by 0.65% (p = 0.004), 0.33% (p = 0.034) and 0.23% (p = 0.017), respectively. LDL-cholesterol was reduced by semaglutide (p = 0.05) and liraglutide (p = 0.02), and liraglutide also lowered the urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (p = 0.007). There was no change in body weight and HbA1c in the usual care group. No severe hypoglycaemia or diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) events were reported in any group. CONCLUSION: Tirzepatide, semaglutide, and liraglutide reduced bodyweight and improved in selected metabolic risk markers over 12 months without increasing the risk for hypoglycaemia or DKA. Weight loss appeared less compared with patients without diabetes. Tirzepatide, semaglutide and liraglutide modestly improved glycaemic control in adults with T1D and obesity. These findings support the potential adjunctive role of GLP-1 receptor agonists in people with obesity and T1D and underscore the need for further validation through randomized controlled trials.

10.3892/ijmm.2025.5651	The gut‑skin axis: Emerging insights in understanding and treating skin diseases	Zhao Y, Yu C, Zhang J, Yao Q, Zhu X, Zhou X	Emerging evidence indicates a significant association between the composition and functionality of the gut microbiome and various skin disorders, including psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, acne and several dermatological conditions. The gut‑skin axis theory describes a complex bidirectional communication network between the gut and the skin, providing mechanistic insights into the pathogenesis of certain cutaneous diseases. Specifically, the gut microbiome influences skin health through the regulation of systemic immunity, inflammatory responses and metabolic pathways. Advances in high‑throughput sequencing and bioinformatics technologies have substantially enhanced the understanding of the role of the gut microbiome in skin pathology. Clinical and preclinical studies have demonstrated that restoring gut microbial homeostasis via interventions such as faecal microbiota transplantation, probiotics and prebiotics can ameliorate symptoms of skin diseases. Furthermore, personalized microbiome‑based therapies, next‑generation probiotics and dietary modifications hold promise for refining gut‑skin interactions and advancing precision medicine in dermatology. Therapeutic strategies targeting the gut‑skin axis offer novel avenues for innovative dermatological treatments, with future breakthroughs potentially involving microbial community engineering, postbiotics and artificial intelligence in microbiome‑related diagnostics. This narrative review summarizes recent advances in gut‑skin axis research, explores its potential in the prevention and management of selected dermatoses and discusses future trends and scientific developments in the field.

10.1172/JCI190017	Targeting specific kinase substrates rescues increased colitis severity induced	Heaton GR, Li X, Li X, Zhou X, Zhang Y, Vu DT, Oeller M, Karayel O, Hoang QQ, Kars ME, Kamath N, Wang M, Tarassishin L, Mann M, Peter I, Yue Z	LRRK2 contains a kinase domain where the N2081D Crohn's disease (CD) risk and the G2019S Parkinson's disease (PD) pathogenic variants are located. It is not clear how the N2081D variant increases CD risk or how these adjacent mutations give rise to distinct disorders. To investigate the pathophysiology of the CD-linked LRRK2 N2081D variant, we generated a knock-in (KI) mouse model and compared its effects with those of the LRRK2-G2019S mutation. Lrrk2N2081D KI mice demonstrated heightened sensitivity to induced colitis, resulting in more severe intestinal damage than in Lrrk2G2019S KI and WT mice. Analysis of colon tissue revealed distinct mutation-dependent LRRK2 RAB substrate phosphorylation, with significantly elevated phosphorylated RAB10 levels in Lrrk2N2081D mice. In cells, we demonstrated that the N2081D mutation activates LRRK2 through a mechanism distinct from that of LRRK2-G2019S. We also found that proinflammatory stimulation enhances LRRK2 kinase activity, leading to mutation-dependent differences in RAB phosphorylation and inflammatory responses in dendritic cells (DCs). Finally, we show that knockout of Rab12, but not pharmacological LRRK2 kinase inhibition, significantly reduced colitis severity in Lrrk2N2081D mice. Our study characterizes the pathogenic mechanisms of LRRK2-linked CD, highlights structural and functional differences between disease-associated LRRK2 variants, and suggests RAB proteins as promising therapeutic targets for modulating LRRK2 activity in CD treatment.

10.1002/adma.202512531	Environmental Response Temporal Release Injectable Hydrogel for Controlled Growth	Qiu P, Ouyang Y, Liu S, Dai J, Wang R, Zhao W, Xu C, Fan Z	Regeneration of periodontal bone defects in an inflammatory microenvironment remains challenging due to oxidative stress and excessive bone resorption. Although various biomaterials have been developed, current strategies often fail to address the combined obstacles of immune dysregulation, oxidative damage, and bone loss. An injectable multifunctional hydrogel (HTF@HA) with a dynamic borate ester cross-linked network is designed to provide environmental responsiveness and temporal release of bioactive factors. Under acidic and oxidative conditions, the hydrogel degrades more rapidly and preferentially releases antioxidative and anti-inflammatory components, facilitating macrophage polarization toward the M2 phenotype and alleviating inflammation. During the subsequent repair phase, calcium-phosphate interactions mediate the sustained release of concentrated growth factors (CGF) and low-dose bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2), supporting osteogenic differentiation and angiogenesis. In vitro, HTF@HA exhibits high biocompatibility, antioxidative capacity, anti-inflammatory effects, and significant enhancement of periodontal ligament stem cell osteogenesis and endothelial cell angiogenesis under inflammatory conditions. Animal studies confirm that the hydrogel promoted new bone and vessel formation (p < 0.001), and at a BMP-2 dose of 50 µg/L, it achieved bone regeneration comparable to high-dose	Advanced materials (Deerfield Beach, Fla.)	04/10/2025
10.3389/fimmu.2025.1635757	Efficacy and safety of immune checkpoint inhibitors for advanced squamous	Liu N, Zhang B, He J, Li S	OBJECTIVE: Significant efficacy heterogeneity exists between first- and second-line immunotherapy regimens for advanced squamous non-small cell lung cancer (SqNSCLC), but most regimens lack directly comparable clinical trial evidence, resulting in unclear prioritization. This analysis identifies optimal treatment strategies by evaluating differences in efficacy across immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). METHODS: We search through comprehensive databases, including PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library and the Clinical Trials Database. Traditional meta-analysis was done using Stata 15.0, while Bayesian-framework network meta-analysis was implemented with R's GEMTC package via Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation. Subgroup analyses were performed for different PD-L1 expression levels, number of treatments, ethnic groups, and smoking history. RESULTS: We included 25 randomized controlled trials. Immune-related therapy can provide significant benefit relative to chemotherapy alone in advanced SqNSCLC. Compared with chemotherapy, except for ipilimumab+chemo [HR = 0.92,95%CI: (0.59-1.40)], atezolizumab+chemo [HR = 0.88, 95%CI: (0.56-1.40)], and durvalumab+chemo [HR = 0.84, 95% CI: (0.52-1.40)], durvalumab+ tremelimumab+chemo [HR = 0. 88, 95% CI: (0.54-1.40)], which significantly improved overall survival(OS). Cemiplimab [HR = 0.48, 95% CI: (0.34-0.67)] showed the best OS benefit. Compared with chemotherapy, all immunotherapies significantly improved progression-free survival (PFS) except for ipilimumab+chemo [HR = 0.87, 95% CI: (0.75-1.00)]. Sugemalimab+chemo provided the best survival benefit [HR = 0.34, 95% CI: (0.24-0.48)]. For PD-L1≥50% tumors, penpulimab showed excellent OS and PFS; for PD-L1 1-49% tumors, pembrolizumab+chemo and camrelizumab+chemo achieved the best OS and PFS, respectively; for PD-L1≥1% tumors, the tislelizumab+chemo and camrelizumab+chemo showed the best OS and PFS results, while for tumors with	Frontiers in immunology	01/01/2025

Here, we investigate the impact of RAD21L deletion, a meiosis-specific cohesin subunit, on the 3D genome architecture and gene expression in the male germ line. Using fluorescence-activated cell sorting, high-throughput chromosome conformation capture, and single-cell RNA sequencing, we demonstrate that RAD21L deficiency impairs meiotic chromatin organization and inter/intrachromosomal interactions. This conspicuous 3D genome reorganization also disrupts bouquet formation, resulting in increased telomeric interactions between heterologous chromosomes in primary spermatocytes. Genome reorganization was accompanied by detectable transcriptional dysregulation in spermatogonia and primary spermatocytes, mainly affecting sex chromosomes. Collectively, our findings establish the cohesin RAD21L as a germline-specific critical regulator of genome-wide 3D genome reorganization during spermatogenesis and a modulator of the male germline transcriptional landscape.

10.1016/j.cell.2025.09.004	Functional RNA splitting drove the evolutionary emergence of type V CRISPR-Cas	Jin S, Zhu Z, Li Y, Zhang S, Liu Y, Li D, Li Y, Luo Y, Cheng Z, Zhao KT, Gao Q, Yang G, Li H, Liang R, Zhang R, Qiu JL, Zhang YE, Liu JG, Gao C	Transposon-encoded TnpB nucleases gave rise to type V CRISPR-Cas12 effectors through multiple independent domestication events. These systems use different RNA molecules as guides for DNA targeting: transposon-derived right-end RNAs (reRNAs or omega RNAs) for TnpB and CRISPR RNAs for type V CRISPR-Cas systems. However, the molecular mechanisms bridging transposon activity and CRISPR immunity remain unclear. We identify TranCs (transposon-CRISPR intermediates) derived from distinct IS605- or IS607-TnpB lineages. TranCs utilize both CRISPR RNAs and reRNAs to direct DNA cleavage. The cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of LaTranC from Lawsonibacter sp. closely resembles that of the ISDra2 TnpB complex; however, unlike a single-molecule reRNA, the LaTranC guide RNA is functionally split into a tracrRNA and crRNA. An engineered RNA split of ISDra2 TnpB enabled activity with a CRISPR array. These findings indicate that functional RNA splitting was the primary molecular event driving the emergence of diverse type V CRISPR-Cas systems from transposons.	Cell	29/09/2025
10.1007/s40259-025-00744-y	Biological Therapies in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease: New Directions in	Mappin-Kasirer B, Pavord ID	Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a leading cause of global morbidity and mortality, is a complex and heterogeneous respiratory condition characterised by incompletely reversible airflow obstruction on spirometry. The aetiologies and pathological patterns of COPD are varied, which has long been viewed as a hindrance to targeted treatment. Yet inflammation is central to the diverse mechanisms of COPD pathogenesis, and type 2 inflammation has emerged as a measurable, modifiable and clinically meaningful therapeutic target in those patients in whom it is identified. The approval of first biological therapy against type 2 inflammation in COPD builds on our understanding of immunological mechanisms in airways diseases, is informed by a decade of randomised trials and makes possible a fundamental shift in our approach to this common condition. This review will (1) assess aspects of pathological inflammation in COPD, namely type 1, 2 and 3 inflammation, and the role of epithelial alarmins; (2) examine data from randomised trials on the efficacy and safety of monoclonal antibodies against inflammatory mediators in COPD; and (3) discuss future directions for biological therapies in COPD, including new patient populations, new agents and new approaches that focus on high-risk disease and open the door to prevention.

Zakharov PN, Chowdhury CS, Peterson OJ, Barron B, Vomund AN, Gorvel L, Unanue ER, Klechevsky E, Wan X, Ravichandran KS	The primary driver of type I diabetes is the autoimmune T cells that destroy insulin-producing β-cells within the islets of Langerhans in the pancreas(1). Pancreatic islet macrophages have also been variably linked to disease onset and progression. As macrophage-mediated removal of dying cells through efferocytosis regulates tissue homeostasis and immune responses(2), here we investigated how efferocytosis by intra-islet macrophages influences the immune environment of pancreatic islets. Using a series of complementary omics-based and functional approaches, we identify a subset of anti-inflammatory intra-islet efferocytic macrophages (e-Mac) within the pancreas of mice and humans. When limited β-cell apoptosis is induced in vivo in wild-type C57BL/6 mice and diabetic-prone NOD mice, islet macrophages adopt this e-Mac phenotype without an apparent increase in the total numbers of intra-islet macrophages. Such limited β-cell apoptosis and increase in e-Mac numbers led to long-term suppression of autoimmune diabetes in NOD mice. This e-Mac phenotype could also be recapitulated ex vivo by co-culturing macrophages with apoptotic β-cells. Mechanistically, the e-Mac-enriched populations imparted an anergic-like state on CD4(+) T cells ex vivo and promoted accumulation of such anergic-like CD4(+) T cells in vivo within the islets. Analysing macrophage-T cell interactions within pancreatic islets using NicheNet and targeted experimental validation, we identify the IGF-1-IGF1R axis as a contributor to the anergic-like T cell phenotype in the islets. Collectively, these data advance a concept that efferocytosis-associated reprogramming of the islet macrophages and the subsequent influence on the adaptive immune response could be beneficial in modulating diabetic autoimmunity.

10.1016/S0140-6736(25)01148-1	Oral iptacopan therapy in patients with C3 glomerulopathy: a randomised,	Kavanagh D, Bomback AS, Vivarelli M, Nester CM, Remuzzi G, Zhao MH, Wong EKS, Wang Y, Krishnan I, Schuhmann I, Trapani AJ, Webb NJA, Meier M, Israni RK, Smith RJH	BACKGROUND: C3 glomerulopathy is an ultra-rare, severe form of glomerulonephritis caused by overactivation of the alternative complement pathway. We aimed to assess efficacy and safety of iptacopan (LNP023), an oral, proximal complement inhibitor that targets factor B to selectively inhibit the alternative pathway of the complement cascade. METHODS: APPEAR-C3G was a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 study of iptacopan versus placebo (both in addition to supportive care [renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors] and immunosuppression). Adult participants (aged 18-60 years) with biopsy-confirmed C3 glomerulopathy were enrolled from 35 hospitals or medical centres in 18 countries. Inclusion criteria included reduced serum C3 concentration (ie, <77 mg/dL [defined as <0·85 × lower limit of the central laboratory normal range]) at screening, urine protein-creatinine ratio (UPCR) of 1·0 g/g or higher at day -75 and day -15 before randomisation, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 30 mL/min per 1·73 m(2) or higher at screening and day -15, and vaccination against Neisseria meningitidis and Streptococcus pneumoniae. All eligible participants were randomised 1:1 via interactive response technology to either the iptacopan or the placebo group, stratified by treatment with corticosteroids, mycophenolic acid, or both (yes or no). During the 6-month double-blind period, participants orally received either iptacopan 200 mg twice daily or placebo; this was followed by a 6-month open-label period in which all participants received iptacopan 200 mg twice daily. The primary endpoint was relative reduction in proteinuria (measured by log-transformed ratio to baseline in UPCR sampled from a 24-h urine collection) at 6 months. The primary analyses were done in the full analysis set (ie, all participants to whom study treatment was assigned by randomisation); all participants who received at least one dose of study treatment were included in the safety analysis. This trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04817618) and the adult cohort has been completed. FINDINGS: Between July 28, 2021, and Feb 15, 2023, 132 participants were screened, of whom 58 did not complete the screening period and 74 (64% male; 69% White) were randomised 1:1 to receive either iptacopan (n=38) or placebo (n=36). One participant in the placebo group discontinued treatment during the open-label period. The 24-h UPCR percentage change relative to baseline at 6 months was -30·2% (95% CI -42·8 to -14·8) in the iptacopan group and 7·6% (-11·9 to 31·3) in the placebo group. In the iptacopan group, the geometric mean of 24-h UPCR was 3·33 g/g (95% CI 2·79 to 3·97) at baseline and 2·17 g/g (1·62 to 2·91) at 6 months; in the placebo group, this was 2·58 g/g (2·18 to 3·05) at baseline and 2·80 g/g (2·37 to 3·30) at 6 months. The primary endpoint was met with a relative reduction in 24-h UPCR at 6 months for iptacopan versus placebo of 35·1% (13·8 to 51·1; p=0·0014). 30 (79%) of 38 participants in the iptacopan group had treatment-emergent adverse events, compared with 24 (67%) of 36 participants in the placebo group; most of these were of mild or moderate severity. There were no deaths, no treatment discontinuations due to treatment-emergent adverse events, and no meningococcal infections. Serious adverse events were reported in three (8%) participants in the iptacopan group and one (3%) participant in the placebo group. INTERPRETATION: Iptacopan showed a statistically significant, clinically meaningful proteinuria reduction in addition to RAAS inhibitors and immunosuppression at 6 months. Iptacopan was well tolerated with an acceptable safety profile in patients with C3 glomerulopathy. FUNDING: Novartis Pharma.	Lancet (London, England)	25/09/2025
10.1038/s41392-025-02415-4	Multiple sclerosis: molecular pathogenesis and therapeutic intervention.	Boutitah-Benyaich I, Eixarch H, Villacieros-Álvarez J, Hervera A, Cobo-Calvo Á, Montalban X, Espejo C	Multiple sclerosis is a chronic immune-mediated disorder of the central nervous system characterized by demyelination, axonal loss, and neuroinflammation, culminating in progressive neurological disability. Despite significant advances in understanding its immunopathogenesis, current immunotherapies remain limited in their ability to halt disease progression, making multiple sclerosis incurable and highlighting the critical need for novel therapeutic strategies. Antigen-specific immunotherapy represents a groundbreaking approach that aims to restore immune tolerance to myelin-derived antigens while preserving the protective functions of the immune system. Unlike broad immunosuppressive strategies, antigen-specific immunotherapy offers the potential for highly targeted modulation of pathogenic immune responses, reducing off-target effects and enhancing safety profiles. Over the last two decades, preclinical studies and clinical trials have explored diverse antigen-specific immunotherapy modalities, ranging from peptide-based vaccines to nanoparticle platforms, each aimed at achieving durable tolerance in multiple sclerosis. This review provides a comprehensive overview of multiple sclerosis, covering its etiology, clinical features, pathogenesis, pathology, and current therapeutic approaches. Thus, it delves into the current state of antigen-specific immunotherapy research, critically examining its successes and limitations while addressing the translational challenges that must be overcome to realize its therapeutic potential. By integrating insights from immunology, biotechnology, and translational medicine, we propose directions for advancing antigen-specific approaches in the quest for transformative multiple sclerosis therapies.

10.1016/j.landig.2025.100900	How can artificial intelligence transform the training of medical students and	Ning Y, Ong JCL, Cheng H, Wang H, Ting DSW, Tham YC, Wong TY, Liu N	Advances in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly generative AI, hold promise for transforming medical education and physician training in response to increasing health-care demands and shortages in the global health-care workforce. Meanwhile, challenges remain in the effective and equitable integration of AI technology into medical education and physician training worldwide. This Viewpoint explores the opportunities and challenges of such an integration. We study the evolving role of AI in medical education, its potential to enhance high-fidelity clinical training, and its contribution to research training using real-world examples. We also highlight ethical concerns, particularly the unclear boundaries of appropriate use of AI and call for clear guidelines to govern the integration of AI into medical education and physician training. Furthermore, this Viewpoint discusses practical constraints, including human, financial, and resource constraints, in AI integration, and emphasises the need for comprehensive cost evaluations and collaborative funding models to support the sustainable implementation of AI integration. A tight collaborative network between health-care institutions and systems, medical schools and universities, industry partners, and education and health-care regulatory agencies could lead to an AI-transformed medical education and physician training scheme that ultimately supports the adoption and integration of AI into clinical medicine and potentially brings about tangible improvements in global health-care delivery.

10.1002/ajh.70074	TEG and ROTEM: Technology and Clinical Applications, 2026 Update.	Longacre MM, Ibla JC	Viscoelastic testing (VET) has evolved significantly since its inception in the mid-20th century, when it was first developed to guide transfusion strategies in trauma and surgical patients. Initially, VET technologies such as TEG and ROTEM assessed clot formation by measuring the mechanical resistance of a pin or piston within a blood sample. Recent advances have introduced automated, cartridge-based systems and novel detection methods-including resonance frequency and ultrasound-based sonorheometry-these new systems allow for more precise, rapid, and user-friendly assessment of clot dynamics at the point of care. VET is now indicated for a wide range of clinical scenarios where complex coagulopathy is anticipated, including trauma, cardiac surgery, liver transplantation, obstetric hemorrhage, and hematologic disorders such as DIC. Its use is expanding into new populations, including pediatric cardiac surgery, patients with inflammatory bowel disease, and those with COVID-19. However, VET remains limited in its ability to reliably detect therapeutic anticoagulants and certain congenital bleeding disorders, such as von Willebrand disease and deficiencies of protein C, S, and antithrombin. Technical limitations, including potential discrepancies between in vitro and in vivo clot formation, and lack of FDA approval for pediatric use have imposed implementation barriers to centers interested in pediatric VET. Looking forward, the integration of VET data with electronic medical records, the development of predictive models, artificial intelligence, and continued innovation in platelet function assessment and detection technologies are poised to enhance the clinical utility of VET. As guidelines and evidence continue to evolve, VET is positioned to become an increasingly important tool for real-time, individualized management of coagulopathy in diverse patient populations.

Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) has emerged as an effective interventional treatment of recurrent ascites and variceal bleeding. However, up to 30% of patients with recurrent ascites show TIPS refractory ascites, and prior data have shown that the frequency of paracenteses before TIPS implantation predicts ascites clearance indicating that TIPS implantation may be too late in some patients. Especially, patients with grade 2 ascites and a MELD score ≥ 15, or grade 3 ascites irrespective of MELD score at first decompensation with ascites face a high risk of further decompensation and mortality. Therefore, these patients may benefit from early TIPS implantation in order to improve post-TIPS mortality. We hypothesise that early TIPS implantation in these selected patients at the time of the first decompensation may improve transplantation-free survival compared to standard medical treatment (SMT). METHODS: The eTIPS study is a prospective, randomised, open, multicenter interventional, superiority trial. Patients will be randomised 1:1 in the intervention group with TIPS implantation and in the SMT group. The primary endpoint is transplantation-free survival. Secondary endpoints include the time to ascites with need for paracentesis and quality of life assessed six and 12 months after randomisation. DISCUSSION: Expanding the concept of early TIPS implantation to ascites management may offer significant survival benefits and may significantly change the treatment algorithm of patients with ascites.

OBJECTIVE: To compare the effectiveness of a strategy preferring acute surgical ASDH evacuation with one preferring initial conservative treatment. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This comparative effectiveness study used data from February 1, 2014, to July 31, 2018, from the prospective observational Transforming Research and Clinical Knowledge in Traumatic Brain Injury Study, conducted at 18 Level 1 trauma centers in the US. The study included patients with nonpenetrating TBI presenting to the emergency department and admitted within 24 hours after injury with ASDH detected on acute head computed tomography scan. Statistical analysis was performed from December 1, 2022, to December 20, 2024. EXPOSURES: Acute surgical hematoma evacuation vs initial conservative treatment, comparing outcomes between centers according to treatment preferences, measured by the case mix-adjusted probability of undergoing acute surgery (vs conservative treatment) per center. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Functional disability at 6 months was assessed with the Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended at 6 months, analyzed with ordinal logistic regression adjusted for prespecified confounders, quantified with a common odds ratio (OR). Variation in center preference was quantified with a median OR (MOR). RESULTS: Of 2697 included patients, 711 (mean [SD] age, 46.5 [19.4] years; 539 men [76%]) had an ASDH, of whom 148 (21%) underwent acute cranial surgery and 563 (79%) underwent initial conservative treatment. The acute surgery cohort had lower mean (SD) Glasgow Coma Scale scores (6.8 [4.4] vs 11.4 [4.6]), more pupil abnormalities (both pupils unreacting: 43 of 133 [32%] vs 41 of 477 [9%]), and fewer isolated ASDHs (eg, more with concurrent intracranial lesions; 92 of 133 [69%] vs 297 of 563 [53%%]) compared with the conservative treatment cohort. In the surgical cohort, 129 of 148 patients (87%) underwent decompressive craniectomy (DC), and 17 of 148 (11%) underwent craniotomy. In the conservative treatment cohort, 67 of 563 patients (12%) underwent delayed cranial surgery (DC or craniotomy). The proportion of patients undergoing acute surgery ranged from 0% to 86% (median, 17% [IQR, 5%-27%]) between centers, with up to a 3-fold higher probability of prognostically similar patients receiving acute surgery in one center compared with another random center (MOR, 2.95 [95% CI, 1.79-7.47]; P = .06). Center preference for acute surgery over initial conservative treatment was not associated with a better outcome (OR, 1.05 [95% CI, 0.88-1.26] per 22% [IQR, 5%-27%] increase in acute surgery at a given trauma center). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this comparative effectiveness study, similar patients with traumatic ASDH were treated differently due to center-specific treatment preferences. Outcomes were similar in centers preferring surgical evacuation and those preferring initial conservative treatment. This study suggests that, for a patient with ASDH for whom a neurosurgeon experiences clinical equipoise between acute surgery vs (initial) conservative treatment, conservative treatment may be considered.

Here, we show that targeting SREBP-dependent lipogenesis via FGH10019, an orally available SREBP inhibitor, enhances docetaxel-induced cytotoxicity in human prostate cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, suppression of lipid biosynthesis leads to a shift in cellular lipid composition toward polyunsaturated lipids, resulting in increased membrane permeability and intracellular docetaxel accumulation. Thus, our findings reveal a critical role of de novo lipogenesis in protecting cancer cells from chemotherapeutics and suggest that treatment with lipogenesis inhibitors could improve the efficacy of chemotherapy against human prostate cancer.

Tsui WHA, Jiang P, Lo YMD	"The analysis of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) fragmentation patterns, known as ""fragmentomics,"" has opened new opportunities in noninvasive cancer diagnostics. Due to its close relationships with genomic organization and cell death, cfDNA fragmentomics lies at the intersection of many aspects of cancer biology, including epigenetic dysregulation, transcriptomic alterations, and aberrant cellular turnover patterns. Recent advances in library preparation, sequencing technologies, and integrative epigenomic-fragmentomic analyses have uncovered novel fragmentomic features that reveal specific cellular dysfunctions in cancer. Additionally, cutting-edge artificial intelligence algorithms now harness high-dimensional fragmentomic features, boosting the precision and power of cancer detection. Promising results from recent clinical trials evaluating the utility of fragmentomic analyses in real-world settings support its potential. In this review, we explore the exciting frontiers of cfDNA fragmentomics, discuss critical unanswered questions, and highlight future directions to unlock the promise of fragmentomics-based liquid biopsies in cancer care."

However, heterogeneity within SCβ-cell cultures remains problematic for graft safety and function. Magnetic selection of SCβ-cells expressing a unique cell surface marker may help deplete undesirable cell types and facilitate functional maturation. Here, we explored CD19 as a potential cell surface marker for the enrichment of insulin-expressing SCβ-cells. Using CRISPR/Cas9 technology, we created a knock-in add-on of CD19-mScarlet downstream of the insulin coding sequence in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). We developed and optimized a magnetic sorting protocol for CD19-mScarlet-expressing cells, forming enriched SCβ-cell clusters with improved glucose-stimulated c-peptide secretion. This strategy holds promise to facilitate large-scale production of functional SCβ-cells for disease modeling and cell replacement therapy.	Disease models & mechanisms	06/10/2025

We aimed to characterise metabolic reprogramming in RCC and develop an artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled plasma metabolic model for RCC detection. METHODS: In this multicentre diagnostic model development and validation study, plasma samples from RCC patients and healthy controls (HCs) were collected across five hospitals between December 2019 and October 2023. Eligible patients had pathologically confirmed RCC without prior treatment; HCs were recruited from routine physical examination. Participants with a history of malignancy were excluded. Untargeted plasma metabolomics was conducted to identify candidate metabolites via a support vector machine, further confirmed by a high-resolution targeted metabolic analysis. An AI-aided diagnostic model, Renal Cell Carcinoma Artificial Intelligence Detector (RCAID), was developed using selected metabolites and validated in six independent validation cohorts. Multiomic analyses were performed to elucidate the underlying metabolic mechanisms. KEY FINDINGS AND LIMITATIONS: The study enrolled 1680 participants, comprising 920 RCC patients and 760 HCs. Among RCC cases, 744 (81%) had clear cell RCC and 633 (69%) had stage I disease. Seven key plasma metabolites, including 2-hydroxyphenylacetic acid, azelaic acid, N,N-dimethylglycine, N-acetyl-L-aspartic acid, N-epsilon-acetyl-L-lysine, proline, and (Z,Z)-4-oxo-2,5-hetpadienedioic acid, were identified and used to develop the RCAID model, which demonstrated an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.988 in the training cohort (n = 503). The model exhibited excellent diagnostic performance, with AUROCs of 0.977, 0.911, 0.945, and 0.972 in the internal (n = 202), external (n = 158), multicentre (n = 346), and temporal (n = 123) validation cohorts, respectively. Additionally, RCAID achieved an AUROC of 0.940 in the late-stage RCC (n = 179) and 0.932 in the non-clear cell RCC (n = 169) validation cohorts. Multiomic analyses further revealed six RCAID-associated dysregulated metabolic pathways in RCC. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: This study identified metabolic alterations in RCC and developed a promising AI-based plasma metabolic model with potential clinical application for RCC diagnosis.

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection and vitamin D deficiency have been put forward as causal factors for the development of MS, but their effects have not been conclusively linked to the disruption of myelin maintenance. Interestingly, both EBV infection and vitamin D deficiency increase the levels of hepcidin, an acute-phase peptide hormone that inhibits iron absorption. The current understanding of iron dysregulation in MS is that iron accumulates in deep gray matter brain structures which leads to disability progression. However, recent studies have revealed that the apparent iron influx may be an artefact of disease-related brain atrophy, and that iron is in contrast depleted in the deep gray matter in MS, which could cause iron deficiency in oligodendrocytes (the cells producing myelin), leading to their demise due to a mitochondrial energy deficit, with consequent demyelination. EBV infection, vitamin D deficiency and iron deficiency may converge as causal risk factors for MS. Dismantling the current understanding that iron excess underpins MS would improve testing and optimization of iron parameters and vitamin D as part of clinical management of MS. This review additionally explores the risk factors for lytic reactivation of EBV which is hypothesized to drive MS disease activity. Conversely, ensuring that EBV remains in a latent state by ameliorating these risk factors may prevent MS exacerbations and disease worsening.	Metabolic brain disease	04/10/2025

We hypothesised that innate immune mechanisms might be more prominent in ACPA- RA. METHODS: We performed single-cell RNA sequencing of mononuclear cells from peripheral blood (PBMC) and synovial fluid (SFMC) of patients with ACPA- and ACPA+ RA (n = 4 per group: discovery cohort; n = 8 per group: validation cohort). Dendritic cells and proinflammatory cytokine production were analysed by flow cytometry on SFMC from patients with ACPA- RA, ACPA+ RA, and psoriatic arthritis. Interferon (IFN) levels in synovial fluid (SF) and serum were measured in these groups. RESULTS: Several macrophage subsets and cDC2 were enriched in ACPA- RA SF whereas the frequency of Tph and B cells was increased in ACPA+ RA SF. Type I IFN-stimulated genes were detected in SFMC, but not PBMC, of patients with ACPA- RA. A type I IFN signature was also observed in synovial tissue from two patients with ACPA- RA in an independent dataset. IFN levels were higher in SF than serum but IFN-α/β production did not differ between ACPA+ and ACPA- RA. CONCLUSIONS: This study identifies a distinct innate cell composition and type I IFN gene response in synovial joints, but not in peripheral blood, of patients with ACPA- RA. Similar IFN levels across groups suggest the IFN signature may have been primed before the cells entered the joints. These findings provide a foundation for future research on type I IFN responses in ACPA- RA.	Annals of the rheumatic diseases	03/10/2025
10.1016/S2213-2600(25)00283-8	Assessment of the role of small airway dysfunction in relation to exacerbation	Galant SP, Kuks PJM, Kole TM, Kraft M, Siddiqui S, Fabbri LM, Beghé B, Rabe KF, Papi A, Brightling CE, Singh D, Kocks JWH, Franzini L, Vonk JM, Kerstjens HAM, Heijink IH, Pouwels SD, Slebos DJ, van den Berge M	BACKGROUND: Recent surveys suggest that asthma remains inadequately controlled in more than 50% of adults with asthma despite guideline-based standard therapy. Small airways are often under-recognised as major sites of airway obstruction and inflammation. This might be related to lack of assessment with current tools such as impulse oscillometry, and thus under-treatment might explain inadequate control. Small airway dysfunction, which is common in adults with well controlled asthma, might represent an important biomarker of future risk of exacerbations. We aimed to investigate whether small airway dysfunction is present in patients with well controlled asthma and, if so, whether it is a risk factor for future exacerbations in this population. METHODS: The observational Assessment of Small Airways Involvement in Asthma (ATLANTIS) study included 773 extensively characterised patients with asthma aged 18-65 years from 29 primary and specialty clinics in nine countries from June 30, 2014, to March 3, 2017. Patients were required to be diagnosed with asthma at least 6 months before inclusion based on evidence of airway hyper-responsiveness, bronchodilator reversibility, or peak expiratory flow variability. Patients were required to have stable asthma, defined as no asthma exacerbations and regular asthma treatment at a consistent dose for 8 weeks before baseline visits. The current analysis included patients with well controlled asthma, defined as an Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ-6) score of less than 0·75 at baseline. Small airway dysfunction was defined, based on deviation from predicted values of impulse oscillometry parameters, as a Z score of more than 1·645 for R5-R20 (resistance at 5 Hz minus resistance at 20 Hz) and AX (area of reactance) and a Z score of less than -1·645 for X5 (reactance at 5 Hz), with additional analyses exploring severe small airway dysfunction (Z score of 3 or -3). ATLANTIS is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02123667. FINDINGS: Of 773 patients, ACQ-6 assessments were available for 772 patients. Among these patients, 384 (50%) were classified as having well controlled asthma, and small airway dysfunction was present in 108 (36% [95% CI 30-41]) of 304 patients with impulse oscillometry data available for R5-R20, 89 (34% [28-42]) of 261 patients with data for AX, and 79 (26% [21-31]) of 303 patients with data for X5. In the multivariable analysis, we found that R5-R20-defined small airway dysfunction was associated with increased risk of future exacerbations, independent of age, sex, smoking status, Global Initiative for Asthma steps 4-5, previous exacerbations, percentage of predicted FEV(1), ratio of residual volume to total lung capacity, and peripheral blood eosinophil count (hazard ratio [HR] 2·26 [95% CI 1·05-4·85]; p=0·038), whereas AX (2·07 [0·91-4·70]; p=0·082) and X5 (0·86 [0·33-2·21]; p=0·75) were not associated with exacerbations. For severe small airway disease, both R5-R20 (HR 2·80 [95% CI 1·26-6·26]; p=0·012) and AX (2·51 [1·04-6·04]; p=0·041) became independent predictors of future exacerbations, whereas X5 remained non-significant (0·99 [0·29-3·32]; p=0·98). INTERPRETATIONS: We have addressed an undervalued trait by showing that small airway dysfunction is a common, sensitive, early independent risk biomarker for future exacerbations in adults with well controlled asthma.

10.1007/s11064-025-04559-9	The Mitochondrial-Astrocyte-Neuron Triad Hypothesis in Parkinson's Disease: A	Walecha V, Luthra PM	"The medical field has spent many years investigating Parkinson's disease (PD), primarily focusing on its main pathogenic feature, dopaminergic neuronal degeneration. Recent studies indicate that PD develops through a complex pathogenic model that links mitochondria to astrocytes and neurons, creating a destructive metabolic loop, a protein aggregation cycle, and oxidative stress. This review examines how mitochondria integrate with astrocytes and neurons in the ""triad hypothesis,"" offering a multifaceted perspective on PD progression. Despite being previously overlooked, we have observed that astrocytic mitochondria play a central role in maintaining neuroprotection and homeostasis. Given that, dysfunctional mitochondria in astrocytes and neurons lead to metabolic failure, compromised glutamate regulation, while also enhancing α-synuclein aggregation, amplifying neuroinflammation, ferroptotic vulnerability and oxidative stress. Henceforth, this report discusses current insights into astrocyte-neuron metabolic coupling, mitochondrial quality control, and lipid redox imbalance, highlighting the role of astrocytic mitochondria as a strong therapeutic strategy. We discuss experimental and translational approaches that aim to restore triad integrity, including mitophagy enhancement, metabolic reprogramming, mitochondrial transfer, and astrocyte-to-neuron reprogramming. By positioning astrocytic mitochondria at the core of PD pathogenesis, this review advocates novel interventions focused on glial metabolic resilience. This integrated approach addresses three major pathogenic axes. It offers promising potential for disease modification and developing effective therapeutics beyond symptomatic dopamine replacement to correct neurodegenerative conditions."

Here, we show that engineered exosomes with Kras(G12D) specific siRNA (iExoKras(G12D)) reveal a biodistribution in pancreas with negligible toxicity in preclinical studies in mice and Rhesus macaques. Clinical testing of iExoKras(G12D) in the iEXPLORE (iExoKras(G12D) in Pancreatic Cancer) Phase I study employed a non-randomized single-arm classical 3 + 3 dose escalation design (Phase Ia), followed by an accelerated titration design (Phase Ib) (NCT03608631). The primary outcomes included safety, tolerability and target engagement, and the secondary outcomes aimed to assess disease control. Patients with advanced metastatic disease were enrolled after failure of multiple lines of therapy. iExoKras(G12D) therapy was well-tolerated: the primary outcomes were met with iExoKras(G12D) showing no dose-limiting toxicity. The maximum tolerated dose was not reached even at the highest dose. In some cases, iExoKras(G12D) therapy was associated with stable disease response (secondary outcome). Downregulation of KRAS(G12D) DNA and suppression of phospho-Erk was documented together with an increase in intratumoral CD8(+) T cells following treatment. The CD8(+) T cell recruitment priming by iExoKras(G12D) informed on potential efficacy of immune checkpoint therapy and lead to validation testing in preclinical PDAC models. Combination therapy of iExoKras(G12D) and anti-CTLA-4 antibodies, but not anti-PD1, revealed robust pre-clinical anti-tumor efficacy via FAS mediated CD8(+) T cell anti-tumor activity. This first-in-human, precision medicine clinical trial and supporting preclinical functional studies offer new insights into priming of immunotherapy by oncogenic Kras inhibitor for future opportunistic combination therapy for PDAC patients.

We aimed to characterise patients treated for mHSPC across multiple large cohorts and estimate cardiovascular adverse event (AE) risks. METHODS: Leveraging PIONEER's Big Data platform, with databases standardised using the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership model, we defined cohorts and calculated the incidence rates of AEs per 1000 person-years. The time to first event was assessed via a Kaplan-Meier analysis, and the mean cumulative function (MCF) was estimated for recurrent events. Analyses were stratified by therapy and database. KEY FINDINGS AND LIMITATIONS: We included 90 087 mHSPC patients from five databases, treated with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) + androgen receptor pathway inhibitor (ARPI) + docetaxel (DOC) (n = 3743), ADT + ARPI (n = 13 588), ADT + DOC (n = 16 287), or ADT alone (n = 56 469). The distribution of age (63.5-73.7 yr) and comorbidities varied between databases (eg, for hypertension 22-79%). Diabetes was reported in up to 33%, heart failure in 17%, obesity in 25%, and kidney impairment in 26% of men. The highest incidence rates of AEs were as follows: 115 cases (ADT) for acute cardiac events, 403 (ADT + ARPI) for cerebral events, 214 (ADT + ARPI) for thromboembolism, 34 (ADT) for chronic heart failure, and 143 (ADT + ARPI + DOC) for hypertension. The 3-yr acute cardiac event-free survival rate ranged from 79% to 97%, and the 3-yr MCF for acute cardiac events was up to 0.33. Limitations include the retrospective nature and a lack of AE grading. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Our study highlights important heterogeneity in real-world, observational mHSPC data. The included patients demonstrated a substantial comorbidity burden, often exceeding that reported in clinical trials, alongside a high rate of cardiovascular AEs.	European urology focus	03/10/2025
10.1002/adma.202507012	Chimeric Glycoprotein Nanoparticles Elicit Robust Neutralizing Antibodies Against	Sun C, Xie C, Fang XY, Hong DC, Zhang H, Wu PH, Liu YN, Bu GL, Cao DH, Si-Tu MY, Peng YJ, Wang J, Feng GK, Zhong Q, Liu Z, Zeng MS	Epstein‒Barr virus (EBV) is a ubiquitous gammaherpesvirus linked to a broad spectrum of malignancies and autoimmune diseases with no approved therapeutic drugs or vaccines. EBV infection relies on the viral glycoproteins gB and gHgL, which, together, function as the fusion apparatus, mediating viral recognition and membrane fusion in both epithelial and B cells. Despite discovering potent neutralizing antibodies targeting gB and gHgL, the heterogeneous antigen structures and distribution of multiple glycoproteins in the virion hinder rational vaccine design targeting this apparatus complex. In this study, Chimeric nanoparticles (Chimeric-NPs) are designed that co-display EBV fusion apparatus and induce significantly more neutralizing antibodies in mice and nonhuman primates than the cocktail counterparts. It is further demonstrated that the Chimeric-NPs elicited neutralizing antibodies predominantly targeting gB, closely mimicking the antibody induction pattern by the whole EBV virion. Additionally, single-BCR sequencing is used to analyze the B cell response to Chimeric-NP, and a novel gB neutralizing antibody Fab5 targeting a new vulnerable site EBV gB is identified. These findings provide novel candidates and vaccine design strategies for EBV and reveal the underlying mechanisms of antibody induction and immune response regulation by chimera vaccines, with potential implications for all multi-antigen-harbored pathogens.

10.1016/j.amjms.2025.07.018	Relationship Between Depression and Chronic Liver Disease: Potential Role of	Nasir AB, Zouridis S, Aspichueta P, Manka P, Syn WK	Depression is a frequent comorbidity in chronic liver disease (CLD), including Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease (MASLD), viral hepatitis, autoimmune hepatitis (AIH), primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), hemochromatosis, and Wilson's disease. It is associated with worse outcomes, accelerated disease progression, increased hospitalizations, and higher mortality. While antidepressants are commonly prescribed, their effects on liver disease, particularly on liver fibrosis, remain underexplored. This narrative review examines the relationship between depression, CLD, and antidepressants through a literature review of studies published between 2010 and 2024. Some evidence suggests that antidepressants may have antifibrotic properties, as seen in pulmonary fibrosis, but liver-specific data are limited. Understanding their potential role in both mental health and liver disease management could improve patient outcomes. However, significant research gaps remain, and further clinical trials are needed to determine whether antidepressants influence liver fibrosis, disease progression, and overall prognosis in CLD.

A relatively large number of genes, many of which are implicated in mitochondrial function, are known to be involved in OA. For many affected individuals, however, a genetic cause still cannot be identified. METHODS: In large pedigree and additional families, exome sequencing (ES) was used to identify a genetic cause in individuals with so far genetically unresolved OA. Subsequently, mitochondrial function was studied in cultured dermal fibroblasts. RESULTS: ES revealed a heterozygous missense variant in PPIB [NM_000942.5:c.538C>T p.(Arg180Trp)], encoding peptidylprolyl isomerase B, which segregated with clinically isolated OA in 19 individuals from 9 families.

10.1111/nyas.13853	Musical rhythm and reading development: does beat processing matter?	Ozernov-Palchik O, Patel AD	There is mounting evidence for links between musical rhythm processing and reading-related cognitive skills, such as phonological awareness. This may be because music and speech are rhythmic: both involve processing complex sound sequences with systematic patterns of timing, accent, and grouping. Yet, there is a salient difference between musical and speech rhythm: musical rhythm is often beat-based (based on an underlying grid of equal time intervals), while speech rhythm is not. Thus, the role of beat-based processing in the reading-rhythm relationship is not clear. Is there is a distinct relation between beat-based processing mechanisms and reading-related language skills, or is the rhythm-reading link entirely due to shared mechanisms for processing nonbeat-based aspects of temporal structure? We discuss recent evidence for a distinct link between beat-based processing and early reading abilities in young children, and suggest experimental designs that would allow one to further methodically investigate this relationship. We propose that beat-based processing taps into a listener's ability to use rich contextual regularities to form predictions, a skill important for reading development.

10.1186/s12974-025-03545-w	Cerebrospinal fluid neuronal pentraxin levels are associated with tau pathology	Zhang Z, Chen X, Sheng Z, Jiang N, Zou WQ	BACKGROUND: Recent studies have reported that Neuronal Pentraxin 2 (NPTX2), a synapse-associated protein, can significantly predict the progression of cognitive decline. However, the role of the NPTX protein family in the pathological progression of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) in humans remains unclear. METHODS: This study included 263 participants from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, including cognitively normal, mild cognitive impairment, and AD individuals, with a mean age of 73.99 ± 7.43 years. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) NPTX proteins and Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein (GFAP) were quantified by Mass spectrometry, Soluble Triggering Receptor Expressed on Myeloid Cells 2 (sTREM2) by a Meso Scale Discovery-based multiplex immunoassay, and amyloid-beta 42 (Aβ42), phosphorylated tau (P-tau), and total tau (T-tau) by Roche Elecsys immunoassays. We systematically evaluated the associations between NPTX proteins and baseline CSF AD biomarkers, as well as their relationships with longitudinal biomarker changes. Mediation models were applied to explore whether GFAP and sTREM2 mediate the associations between NPTX proteins and T-tau pathology. Additionally, subgroup analyses based on A/T/(N) classification were conducted to assess stage-specific effects, and sensitivity analyses were performed using 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography in place of CSF AD biomarkers. RESULTS: We found that CSF NPTX proteins were significantly associated with CSF sTREM2 (β(NPTX1) = 0.293, p < 0.001; β(NPTX2) = 0.387, p < 0.001; β(NPR) = 0.382, p < 0.001), GFAP (β(NPTX1) = 0.274, p < 0.001; β(NPTX2) = 0.472, p < 0.001; β(NPR) = 0.444, p < 0.001), and core AD biomarkers at baseline. The association between NPTX2 and T-tau levels was significant and independent of Aβ42 (β = 0.619, p < 0.001). Mediation analyses indicated that sTREM2 and GFAP, individually or sequentially, partially mediated the associations between NPTX and T-tau pathology, with stronger effects observed in the suspected non-AD pathology and Stage 2 groups. Pathway analysis suggested that NPTX may influence tau pathology and cognitive function through the sequential sTREM2→GFAP→T-tau or P-tau pathway. CONCLUSIONS: NPTX proteins are associated with tau-related pathology in AD, and CSF GFAP and sTREM2 may mediate these associations, with their roles potentially differing across stages of disease progression.

10.1080/15548627.2025.2568487	Aging-rewired metabolic cues promote autophagy and senescence via DRAM1.	Yang J, Sun H, Xu K, Zhang X, Huang M, Jin G, Liu Y, Chen W, Lin S, Shen J, Zhong CQ, Xu Y, Zhang Q, Liu W, Yang Y, Ou J	Being a major contributor to cell senescence and aging, DNA damage activates macroautophagy/autophagy, but how this process is affected by aging-rewired metabolism in normal biological systems remains to be explored. Here in cultured human umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells (HsMSCs) and the mouse liver that accumulate DNA damage during aging, we found an elevation of DRAM1 (DNA damage regulated autophagy modulator 1) and DRAM1-mediated pro-senescent autophagy (DMPA). Confirming that DRAM1 activated AMPK, we sought DMPA-associated metabolic features and noted substantial enrichment of N-acetylhistamine (N-AcHA) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) products in the aging HsMSCs and mouse liver. Elevating DNA damage and senescence, N-AcHA supplements were sufficient to upregulate DRAM1 and DMPA in primary hepatocytes from young mice but not even in pre-senescent HsMSCs, hence reflecting the differential tolerance of these cell models toward cytotoxic metabolic cues. The effects of N-AcHA were further verified in mouse aging and post-hepatectomy liver regeneration models. In contrast, accumulating cellular PE contents via ethanolamine supplements augmented autophagy but not DNA damage and senescence despite tending to induce DRAM1. Combined treatments with N-AcHA and ethanolamine were sufficient to trigger DMPA in HsMSCs. Despite their differential cellular responses toward N-AcHA and ethanolamine supplements, in primary HsMSCs and mouse hepatocytes DMPA did not notably downregulate SQSTM1/p62 proteins, which differed from general macroautophagy and may constitutively support the fusion of SQSTM1-modified cargo-containing autophagosomes with lysosomes.

10.1016/j.jbior.2025.101119	Induced pluripotent stem cell-based modelling of disease evolution in myeloid	Boultwood J	The myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are common myeloid malignancies that develop from the successive acquisition of driver mutations in hematopoietic stem cells residing in the bone marrow. Around a third of MDS patients will develop secondary acute myeloid leukemia (sAML) and patients with high-risk MDS or sAML have a dismal prognosis. The study of disease progression in myeloid malignancy has been enhanced in recent years by the use of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) technology. iPSCs offer the advantage of indefinite expansion and the potential for genetic modification, with reprogramming enabling the capture of the full complement of genetic lesions found in primary patient bone marrow samples. The power of iPSC and CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing technologies have been harnessed to generate a range of iPSC-based cellular models of MDS, reflecting the genetic and biologic heterogeneity of the disease. Stage-specific patient iPSC lines have been produced and sequential gene editing in normal human iPSCs has been performed to map the evolution of MDS to AML. These studies have increased our understanding of the impact of driver mutations, and co-mutations, on disease phenotype and revealed mechanisms underlying disease stage transitions in myeloid malignancy. iPSC-based models of MDS have also proven important tools in high throughput drug screening and have empowered drug testing and drug discovery, offering a new platform to develop personalized therapy.

10.1186/s40478-025-02124-7	The mGluR5 agonist CHPG enhances human oligodendrocyte differentiation.	Huang Y, Geywitz C, Bandaru A, Glass IA, Schirmer L, Nobuta H, Dreyfus CF	Previous studies in adult mice indicate that the mGluR5 agonist 2-chloro-5-hydroxyphenyl glycine (CHPG), reduces cuprizone-elicited losses in myelin. This effect is partly mediated by CHPG binding to mGluR5 receptors on reactive astrocytes, triggering the release of brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which results in an increase in myelin. However, it remains unclear whether CHPG has similar beneficial effects on human oligodendrocytes. To address this issue, we examined effects of CHPG using both cultured human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived oligodendrocytes and primary human fetal oligodendrocytes. We show that CHPG increases the proportion of MBP(+) mature oligodendrocytes without affecting survival. This effect is mediated by increasing the proliferation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) and enhancing differentiation in young oligodendrocytes. In contrast to observations in mice, mGluR5 expression in humans is localized on PDGFRα(+) OPCs and O4(+) immature oligodendrocytes, but not astrocytes. Using purified human OPC cultures, we show a direct effect of CHPG in increasing the proportion of MBP(+) mature oligodendrocytes. To identify potential cellular targets of CHPG in demyelinating disease, we analyzed postmortem tissue from individuals with chronic active multiple sclerosis (MS) and healthy controls. In contrast to the hiPSCs or primary oligodendrocytes, demyelinated white matter from MS patients shows elevated mGluR5 mRNA expression in astrocytes. Taken together, our findings suggest that CHPG enhances the differentiation of human OPCs through a mechanism distinct from that observed in cuprizone-treated mice. Moreover, astrocytes in MS pathology upregulate mGluR5, suggesting mGluR5 expression changes dynamically under disease conditions.	Acta neuropathologica communications	03/10/2025
10.34133/research.0901	Cancer-Associated Fibroblast-Derived GDF15 Induces Oxidative Stress and	Zhao Z, Cai H, Zhao Z, Wang X, Nie W, Zhao F, Chen Y, Ding Y, Luo Z, Lin Z, Ding Y	Background: Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is a malignant tumor of the oral mucosal epithelium. The high incidence of recurrence and metastasis presents substantial challenges for treatment, underscoring the complex molecular landscape underlying the disease. The purpose of this work is to clarify how HNSCC tumor cells and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) interact. Methods: Spatial transcriptome sequencing and single-cell RNA sequencing had been employed to describe the biological characteristics of CAFs in HNSCC. The biological connection between CAFs and tumor cells was verified by molecular interaction experiments. In addition, the regulatory effect of CAFs on oxidative stress in tumor cells and the phenotypic conversion of neutrophils were explored through a coculture system, a knockdown/overexpression method, flow cytometry, and animal experiments. Finally, potential small-molecule inhibitors were screened by molecular dynamics simulation and validated through in vitro and in vivo assays. Results: Growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) promoted tumor cell growth and invasion by enhancing PCNA clamp associated factor (PCLAF) transcription through interferon regulatory factor 5 modulation. Its interaction with the receptor GDNF family receptor alpha like (GFRAL) triggered chronic inflammatory signaling via the phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase/protein kinase b/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 pathway, which led to oxidative stress imbalance and contributed to tumor progression and the development of drug resistance. Moreover, GDF15 activated the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 pathway through tumor necrosis factor-α, thereby facilitating neutrophil infiltration and promoting lung metastasis in HNSCC. Notably, risperidone (SM-2) emerged as a potential inhibitory regulator capable of disrupting the cascade effects mediated by the GDF15-GFRAL axis, underscoring its therapeutic relevance. Conclusion: This study identifies the GDF15-GFRAL signaling axis as a critical regulator of oxidative stress and immune evasion in HNSCC and demonstrates that the novel small-molecule SM-2 effectively targets this pathway, highlighting its potential as a promising therapeutic strategy.

However, the frequency and clinical relevance of discordant biochemical and LSM changes remain unclear. We aim to determine the performance of the most recent or current LSM (LSMc) in predicting first hepatic decompensation (HD) in the setting of discordant biochemical and LSM responses. METHODS: In this international, multicenter study, we included patients with at least two reliable LSM performed at least six months apart. Patients with prior HD, liver transplantation (LT) or hepatocellular carcinoma were excluded. Biochemical response was based on the Paris-2 criteria. LSM response was defined as stable or any reduction in LSM. The primary outcome was the occurrence of the first HD. Secondary outcomes were LT and liver-related death. The influence of LSM on HD was estimated using Cox regression analysis. RESULTS: A total of 1,793 PBC patients were analyzed. Over a median follow-up of 22 (IQR: 12-39) months, 3.3% developed HD. Up to 55% of PBC patients exhibited discordance between LSM and biochemical response. Among patients with LSM response, achieving Paris-2 criteria was associated with a lower risk of HD (HR 0.25, 95%CI: 0.06-0.97, p<0.044). Among patients with biochemical response, LSM response did not influence the risk of developing HD (HR 0.64, 95%CI: 0.21-1.96, p=0.429). The LSMc >10 kPa strongly predicted HD (HR 14.5, 95% CI 6.9-30.6, p<0.001), irrespective of biochemical response and prior LSM trajectories. CONCLUSIONS: Discordance between LSM and biochemical response is frequent. Most recent or current LSM is the strongest predictor of first liver-related events in patients with PBC, irrespective of prior biochemical response or LSM trajectory. IMPACT AND IMPLICATIONS: Both liver stiffness measurement (LSM) and biochemical response have prognostic significance in patients with primary biliary cholangitis (PBC). However, the clinical relevance and how discordant biochemical and LSM changes should be best interpreted remain unclear. In this large international multicenter study, we demonstrated that once the current LSM (LSMc) is known, prior LSM trajectories and biochemical changes did not improve the prediction of liver-related events in patients with PBC.

10.1080/15502783.2025.2568048	A randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover clinical trial to evaluate the effect	Schönenberger KA, Laval J, Woods T, Truillet R, Naranjo-Modad S, Mettler S, Fança-Berthon P	BACKGROUND: Turmeric may alleviate exercise-induced muscle soreness (delayed onset muscle soreness) and muscular function loss due to the strong anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities of its active compounds, the curcuminoids. The primary objective of this trial was to evaluate the effect of a highly bioavailable turmeric formulation on delayed onset muscle soreness in male adults. METHODS: In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04946981), 44 moderately active adults (34 males, 10 females, mean [SD] age = 33.7 [6.4] years) ingested a turmeric formulation (300 mg/day, thereof 90 mg of active curcuminoids) or placebo for five days. On the second day, muscle damage was induced with exercise (30 min downhill run at 70% VO₂ max). Immediately before and 0, 24, 48, and 72 hours post-exercise, muscle soreness during squat on quadriceps (visual analog scale), muscular function (knee extension dynamometer), muscle power (vertical jump test), muscle damage (serum creatine kinase), range of motion (knee flexion), and perceived wellness and wellbeing (questionnaire) were assessed. During exercise, exhaustion was assessed using the Borg Rating of Perceived Exertion. The primary trial population consisted of the male participants, outcomes in females were considered exploratory. Adjusted least squares means with standard errors (SE) were obtained from mixed models for repeated measures. RESULTS: There were no significant differences between the turmeric formulation and placebo in muscle soreness area under the curve from pre-exercise to 72 hours post-exercise and at all timepoints, except for a trend observed in males 72 hours after exercise (adjusted mean [SE] for difference from placebo = -4.8 [2.7] mm, p = 0.0776). Muscle soreness recovery (difference between soreness at 72 hours and maximal post-exercise soreness) was significantly greater with the turmeric formulation compared to placebo (adjusted mean [SE] for difference from placebo = -10.7% [4.3%], p = 0.0184 for the male participants, and -7.9% [3.6%], p = 0.0346 for the total sample). Furthermore, in males, the decrease from pre-exercise to 24 hours after exercise in isokinetic peak torque was significantly lower with the turmeric formulation (adjusted mean [SE] for difference from placebo = 11.0 [4.9] Nm, p = 0.0275), as was the decrease in isokinetic max rep work (adjusted mean [SE] for difference from placebo = 11.6 [4.9] J, p = 0.0195), while vertical jump peak power at 24 hours after exercise was higher (median [interquartile range] with the turmeric formulation vs. placebo = 931.1 [825.9; 1001.1] W vs. 916.5 [824.8; 989.5] W, p = 0.0445). CONCLUSIONS: Supplementation with the turmeric formulation can accelerate exercise-induced muscle soreness recovery and could attenuate muscular function loss and improve performance after unaccustomed exercise in young, moderately active, male adults.

10.4070/kcj.2025.0001	Current Therapeutic Patterns of Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension in Korea: A	Ha KE, Park S, Chung WJ, Kim GH, Park JH, Choi JH, Kim H, Heo R, Bae DH, Jang Y	BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The 2022 revised pulmonary hypertension guidelines emphasize risk stratification to enhance outcomes, necessitating investigation into adherence. This study aimed to examine the treatment patterns of patients in the Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH) Platform for deep Phenotyping in Korean Subjects (PHOENIKS) study cohort. METHODS: A total of 321 patients from the PHOENIKS cohort were included, consisting of 101 patients in phase 1 (2018-2020) and 220 in phase 2 (2021-2023). A total of 275 patients with either idiopathic PAH or associated PAH were included in the final analysis. Risk assessment was conducted utilizing an online calculator that integrates multiple validated risk stratification models. Adherence to the revised guidelines was evaluated, and survival outcomes were analyzed over the study period. RESULTS: The cohort consisted primarily of middle-aged and female patients (mean age 51.96±15 years, 71% female). A total of 53% had idiopathic PAH and 47% had associated PAH. Intermediate-risk patients comprised 62% of the cohort during the initial diagnosis. The proportion of low-risk patients increased from 34% to 64% throughout the follow-up period. Adherence to the revised guidelines slightly improved during the study period, though only 26% of patients demonstrated compliance. The one-year survival rate was 96%, whereas the 3-year survival rate was 87%. CONCLUSIONS: The current Korean PAH treatment strategy must be improved to align with the revised guidelines and optimize patient outcomes. Further efforts are needed to change health insurance coverage criteria to enhance guideline adherence.	Korean circulation journal	01/08/2025

Its comparative efficacy in children has not been established. METHODS: CARE was a 52-week, open-label, parallel-group, multicentre, superiority, randomised controlled trial in children aged 5-15 years with asthma using SABA reliever monotherapy at 15 clinical trials sites in New Zealand. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to either budesonide 50 μg-formoterol 3 μg, two actuations as needed, or salbutamol 100 μg, two actuations as needed. The primary outcome was asthma attacks as rate per participant per year. This trial was registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry, ACTRN12620001091998. FINDINGS: From Jan 28, 2021, to June 23, 2023, we assessed 382 participants for eligibility. We randomly assigned 360 (94%) participants to treatment (179 [50%] to the budesonide-formoterol group and 181 [50%] to the salbutamol group). The annualised rate of asthma attacks was lower in the budesonide-formoterol group than in the salbutamol group-cluster-adjusted rates 0·23 versus 0·41 per participant per year (relative rate 0·55 [95% CI 0·35-0·86]; p=0·012). The number of participants with at least one adverse event was 162 (91%) in the budesonide-formoterol group and 167 (92%) in the salbutamol group (odds ratio 0·79 [95% CI 0·35-1·79]). INTERPRETATION: In children aged 5-15 years with mild asthma, budesonide-formoterol reliever monotherapy is superior to salbutamol for preventing asthma attacks, with a similar safety profile.

10.1038/s41593-025-02068-0	Single-dose psilocybin rapidly and sustainably relieves allodynia and	Hammo A, Wisser S, Cichon J	Chronic pain and mood disorders co-occur, exacerbate one another and share neurobiological mechanisms, but whether a single intervention could promptly alleviate both conditions remains unclear. Here, in two chronic pain models, we show that a single dose of psilocybin induces a rapid and sustained reversal of both mechanical allodynia and anxiodepression-like states in adult male and female mice. Using local psilocin injections, the key active metabolite of psilocybin, we show that the engagement of prefrontal cortical circuits is critical for the concurrent alleviation of both conditions. Two-photon calcium imaging reveals that psilocin rapidly normalizes chronic pain-associated hyperactivity in anterior cingulate cortex layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons. Pharmacologic manipulations with full agonists of 5-HT(2A) and 5-HT(1A) receptors replicated some, but not all, of psilocin's cellular and behavioral effects, suggesting that psilocin's actions arise from partial agonism at these receptors within shared circuits governing pain and mood processing.

10.1186/s12920-025-02222-4	An ADR pharmaceutical care for severe gastrointestinal bleeding of rivaroxaban in	Huang Y, Gao H, Chen M, Lin Y, Liu H, Chen M	BACKGROUND: Due to its predictable pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics, stable blood concentration, and relatively short half-life, rivaroxaban is widely used in the prevention and treatment of thrombosis. It nevertheless exhibits a certain level of inter-individual variability, and its safety concerns, including bleeding, are also becoming more noteworthy. CASE PRESENTATION: This paper describes an elderly patient with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation that was complicated with coronary heart disease, who is a homozygous mutation carrier of the ABCB1 allele (rs1045642 C > T, rs1128503 C > T, rs2032582 G > T). He was developed severe gastrointestinal bleeding during administration of oral rivaroxaban combined with aspirin. We investigated the possible causes of the bleeding, and any potential correlation with the ABCB1 gene polymorphism, combined with antiplatelet drugs and anemia. CONCLUSION: In the treatment of patients with atrial fibrillation, doctors should pay close attention to drug interactions with antiplatelet agents in high-risk groups and closely monitor various examination indexes, including hemoglobin. In this case, bleeding might be potentially influenced by homozygous mutations in ABCB1, but more clinical data are needed to clarify the association between ABCB1 polymorphism and rivaroxaban pharmacokinetics and bleeding.

10.1038/s41588-025-02355-3	A genetic map of human metabolism across the allele frequency spectrum.	Zoodsma M, Beuchel C, Yasmeen S, Kohleick L, Nepal A, Koprulu M, Kronenberg F, Mayr M, Williamson A, Pietzner M, Langenberg C	Genetic studies of human metabolism have been limited in scale and allelic breadth. Here we provide a data-driven map of the genetic regulation of circulating small molecules and lipoprotein characteristics (249 traits) measured using proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy across the allele frequency spectrum in ~450,000 individuals. Trans-ancestral meta-analyses identify 29,824 locus-metabolite associations mapping to 753 regions with effects largely consistent between men and women and large ancestral groups represented in UK Biobank. We observe and classify extreme genetic pleiotropy, identify regulators of lipid metabolism, and assign effector genes at >100 loci through rare-to-common allelic series. We propose roles for genes less established in metabolic control (for example, SIDT2), genes characterized by phenotypic heterogeneity (for example, APOA1) and genes with specific disease relevance (for example, VEGFA). Our study demonstrates the value of broad, large-scale metabolomic phenotyping to identify and characterize regulators of human metabolism.	Nature genetics	03/10/2025

This study aims to develop a selenium-based nanoplatform that targets mitochondria-ER interactions to reverse inflammatory adipose expansion in TED. Methods: We designed a dual-responsive selenium nanoparticle (Se@LNT) modified with lentinan, capable of ROS/pH-triggered release. Human primary orbital fibroblasts, bioinformatic analysis of public datasets, and TED mouse models were used to investigate the therapeutic mechanism. Results: Se@LNT undergoes intracellular metabolic conversion into selenocysteine, which enhances GPX1 activity and promotes redox balance. It exerts triple regulatory effects by stabilizing mitochondrial membranes to reduce mtDNA leakage, downregulating GRP75 to normalize MAMs contact and calcium flux, and suppressing PERK-eIF2α-ATF4 signaling to relieve ER stress. Transcriptomic profiling reveals multi-target modulation of immune-stromal interactions. In vivo, Se@LNT achieves orbital targeting, rapid hepatic-renal clearance, and significant reduction of adipose expansion with immune remodeling. Conclusions: Se@LNT offers the first MAMs-targeted nanotherapy for TED by reprogramming organelle crosstalk, restoring metabolic-immune homeostasis, and modifying disease progression at the subcellular level.

10.1186/s12967-025-06818-3	VISTA expressed on tumor cells is regulated by m6A and influences immune	Xu H, Shen K, Jiang B, Xu Q, Li B, Ke Z, Cheng Q, Zhu S, Wang D, Song Y, Lv T	BACKGROUND: Immunotherapy is playing an increasingly vital role in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), yet the challenge of immune evasion remains prevalent. Therefore, investigating the regulatory mechanisms of the tumor immune microenvironment could yield significant benefits. METHODS: This study utilized differential expression analysis, WGCNA, and Lasso-Cox to analyze the GSE126044 dataset, identifying N6-methyladenosine (m6A)-related molecules that play significant roles in immunotherapy. The m6A modification of the molecule were validated through m6A dot blot, MeRIP, RNA pull-down and RNA stability assays. Their impact on the biological behavior of tumor cells (TCs) was evaluated by CCK-8 assays, wound healing assays, transwell assays, co-culture experiments and flow cytometry. Furthermore, RNA sequencing was conducted to uncover downstream pathways and cytokines, followed by subsequent validation. Lastly, validation was carried out in vivo. RESULTS: Through bioinformatics analysis, we identified that V-domain Immunoglobulin Suppressor of T cell Activation (VISTA) serves a crucial role in immunotherapy and that its expression is regulated by m6A. It was subsequently confirmed that METTL3 enhances the m6A modification levels of VISTA mRNA, which is recognized by YTHDF1. This interaction improved the stability of VISTA mRNA, leading to increased expression of VISTA proteins on the surface of TCs. The elevated expression of VISTA boosted the cytotoxic response of CD8 + T cells toward TCs. RNA sequencing analysis indicated that the JAK/STAT pathway significantly contributes to this process. Overexpression of VISTA on TCs decreased the phosphorylation of STAT3, which in turn reduced the expression and release of CCL22. This reduction alleviated immune suppression within the tumor microenvironment, resulting in increased enrichment and activity of CD8 + T cells and decreased enrichment of regulatory T cells (Tregs), ultimately enhancing their cytotoxic effects against TCs. CONCLUSION: We conduct a pioneering systematic study on the expression, function, and molecular mechanisms of the VISTA molecule on NSCLC TCs. We propose that in the tumor immune microenvironment, VISTA functions as both an immune checkpoint and a regulator of CD8 + T cell activation/recruitment and Treg recruitment via its expression on TCs.

10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-24-4916	SPP1 Drives Colorectal Cancer Liver Metastasis and Immunotherapy Resistance by	Liu S, Zhang Z, Wang Z, Liu C, Liang G, Xu T, Li Z, Duan X, Xu G, Feng X, Feng Q, Wang Q, Han D, Zhang C, Li J, Shen L	Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains a major cause of cancer-related morbidity and mortality globally, with 30%-40% of cases developing metastasis, mainly to the liver. Although immunotherapy has shown promise for CRC treatment, patients with CRC liver metastasis (CRLM) experience limited therapeutic benefits, potentially because of an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Thus, an urgent need exists to identify the key players that drive CRLM and potentiate immunotherapeutic resistance. Herein, we established liver metastatic cells through continuous passaging in vivo, allowing the screening of RNA expression profiles related to CRLM. A combination of spatial transcriptomic sequencing and single-cell analysis revealed a substantial upregulation of SPP1 expression and secretion in CRLM. SPP1 induced immunotherapeutic resistance by stimulating CXCL12 production by cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) through activation of β-catenin/HIF-1α-related transcription. CXCL12 promoted epithelial-mesenchymal transition of CRC cells but suppressed CD8+ T cell infiltration. Treatment with a CXCL12 receptor antagonist or anti-SPP1 antibody markedly activated intratumoral CD8+ T cell infiltration and enhanced the efficacy of anti-PD-1 antibody treatment. Elevated SPP1 and CXCL12 corresponded to immunotherapy resistance in CRLM patients. Together, this study highlights the potential of the SPP1/CXCL12 axis as a target and a biomarker for precise cancer immunotherapy in CRLM. The intricate interactions within the TME offer promising avenues for improving therapeutic outcomes in CRC patients with liver metastasis.	Cancer research	06/10/2025
10.1038/s41386-025-02256-3	Preclinical efficacy of the muscarinic agonist ML-007 in psychosis models depends	Chatterjee S, Soria M, Norville ZC, Thompson KR, Lillie J, Kreitzer AC, Wood MW	Muscarinic agonists represent a new class of treatments for psychosis with a mechanism distinct from typical and atypical antipsychotics. The muscarinic subtype M(4) has been proposed as the primary mediator of efficacy but results from recent clinical trials with M(4)-selective compounds have drawn this hypothesis into question. Instead, activation of both M(1) and M(4) receptor subtypes may be required for robust treatment effects. Here, we characterize the clinical-stage muscarinic agonist ML-007 in preclinical models and explore its therapeutic potential for treating psychosis in schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease. ML-007 is a potent brain-penetrant agonist at both M(1) and M(4) muscarinic receptors that has demonstrated compelling efficacy across a range of preclinical models of psychosis in schizophrenia including amphetamine-induced hyperlocomotion, PCP-induced hyperlocomotion, and conditioned avoidance response. Moreover, ML-007 is approximately ten-fold more potent than the comparator xanomeline in all animal models. Dose-response experiments in M(1) and M(4) knockout mice reveal that the efficacy of ML-007 is dependent on both M(1) and M(4) receptors. Taken together, our data suggest that both M(1) and M(4) receptors contribute to the potent efficacy of ML-007 in preclinical rodent models of psychosis.

10.1681/ASN.2021040585	Impaired Mineral Ion Metabolism in a Mouse Model of Targeted Calcium-Sensing	Schepelmann M, Ranieri M, Lopez-Fernandez I, Webberley TS, Brennan SC, Yarova PL, Graca J, Hanif UK, Müller C, Manhardt T, Salzmann M, Quasnichka H, Price SA, Ward DT, Gilbert T, Matchkov VV, Fenton RA, Herberger A, Hwong J, Santa Maria C, Tu CL, Kallay E, Valenti G, Chang W, Riccardi D	BACKGROUND: Impaired mineral ion metabolism is a hallmark of CKD-metabolic bone disorder. It can lead to pathologic vascular calcification and is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular mortality. Loss of calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) expression in vascular smooth muscle cells exacerbates vascular calcification in vitro. Conversely, vascular calcification can be reduced by calcimimetics, which function as allosteric activators of CaSR. METHODS: To determine the role of the CaSR in vascular calcification, we characterized mice with targeted Casr gene knockout in vascular smooth muscle cells ( (SM22α) CaSR (Δflox/Δflox) ). RESULTS: Vascular smooth muscle cells cultured from the knockout (KO) mice calcified more readily than those from control (wild-type) mice in vitro. However, mice did not show ectopic calcifications in vivo but they did display a profound mineral ion imbalance. Specifically, KO mice exhibited hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, hyperphosphaturia, and osteopenia, with elevated circulating fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23), calcitriol (1,25-D(3)), and parathyroid hormone levels. Renal tubular α-Klotho protein expression was increased in KO mice but vascular α-Klotho protein expression was not. Altered CaSR expression in the kidney or the parathyroid glands could not account for the observed phenotype of the KO mice. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that, in addition to CaSR's established role in the parathyroid-kidney-bone axis, expression of CaSR in vascular smooth muscle cells directly contributes to total body mineral ion homeostasis.

10.1186/1471-2407-8-221	Esophageal cancer risk by type of alcohol drinking and smoking: a case-control	Vioque J, Barber X, Bolumar F, Porta M, Santibáñez M, de la Hera MG, Moreno-Osset E	BACKGROUND: The effect of tobacco smoking and alcohol drinking on esophageal cancer (EC) has never been explored in Spain where black tobacco and wine consumptions are quite prevalent. We estimated the independent effect of different alcoholic beverages and type of tobacco smoking on the risk of EC and its main histological cell type (squamous cell carcinoma) in a hospital-based case-control study in a Mediterranean area of Spain. METHODS: We only included incident cases with histologically confirmed EC (n = 202). Controls were frequency-matched to cases by age, sex and province (n = 455). Information on risk factors was elicited by trained interviewers using structured questionnaires. Multiple logistic regression was used to estimate adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CI). RESULTS: Alcohol drinking and tobacco smoking were strong and independent risk factors for esophageal cancer. Alcohol was a potent risk factor with a clear dose-response relationship, particularly for esophageal squamous-cell cancer. Compared to never-drinkers, the risk for heaviest drinkers (> or = 75 g/day of pure ethanol) was 7.65 (95%CI, 3.16-18.49); and compared with never-smokers, the risk for heaviest smokers (> or = 30 cigarettes/day) was 5.07 (95%CI, 2.06-12.47). A low consumption of only wine and/or beer (1-24 g/d) did not increase the risk whereas a strong positive trend was observed for all types of alcoholic beverages that included any combination of hard liquors with beer and/or wine (p-trend<0.00001). A significant increase in EC risk was only observed for black-tobacco smoking (2.5-fold increase), not for blond tobacco. The effects for alcohol drinking were much stronger when the analysis was limited to the esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (n = 160), whereas a lack of effect for adenocarcinoma was evidenced. Smoking cessation showed a beneficial effect within ten years whereas drinking cessation did not. CONCLUSION: Our study shows that the risk of EC, and particularly the squamous cell type, is strongly associated with alcohol drinking. The consumption of any combination of hard liquors seems to be harmful whereas a low consumption of only wine may not. This may relates to the presence of certain antioxidant compounds found in wine but practically lacking in liquors. Tobacco smoking is also a clear risk factor, black more than blond.

Environmental and genetic factors, as well as superantigens and toxins from Candida species, may play various roles in the exacerbation and persistence of psoriasis. In the present study, we evaluated candidal colonization and specific humoral responses against Candida albicans in patients with psoriasis. METHODS: A total of 100 patients with psoriasis vulgaris and 50 healthy control individuals were enrolled in the study. Skin and oral specimens from all participants were cultured on CHROMagar Candida medium. Isolated yeast-like fungi were identified using the sequence of the D1/D2 domain of the 26S rRNA gene. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) were used to detect immunoglobulin M (IgM), IgA, and IgG antibodies against C. albicans in sera of patients and healthy individuals. RESULTS: Candida species were isolated from the skin of 15% of patients and 4% of controls and from oral specimens of 60% of patients and 20% of controls. There was a significant difference in candidal colonization between patients and controls (P < 0.05). Serum IgM, IgA, and IgG levels against C. albicans were significantly lower in patients with psoriasis than in controls (P < 0.05). There was no significant association between serum levels of specific antibodies against C. albicans or the frequency of candidal colonization with the clinical severity of the disease (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The results of the present study show a higher rate of candidal colonization in patients with psoriasis in comparison with controls and a reduction in humoral immune responses in patients.

10.3389/fimmu.2025.1614702	Integrating bioinformatics and experimental validation to reveal a novel VRK	Fu Z, Liu D, Chen M, Zhong G, Zhao Z, Gong J, Dai X, Hu J, Jia D, Cheng L, Cai D, Gong J	BACKGROUND: Vaccinia-related kinase (VRK) family genes play a multifunctional role in tumor development. However, the role of VRK family genes in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) requires further research. Moreover, the clinical potential of the VRK-related model remains unclear. The aim of this study is to construct a VRK-related model to predict HCC prognosis and therapeutic efficacy. METHODS: The data of HCC patients were extracted from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC), and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) databases. The single-sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) algorithm was used to calculate the VRK score of each sample. Tumor IMmune Estimation Resource 2.0 (TIMER 2.0) and Tumor Immune Dysfunction and Exclusion (TIDE) were used to evaluate immune cell infiltration and the immune checkpoint response. pRRophetic was used for predicting drug sensitivity. CCK-8, colony formation, wound healing, transwell and xenograft assays were used to experimentally validate the biofunction of VRK2 in HCC. RESULTS: We found that all VRK family genes were highly expressed in HCC. Compared with patients with low VRK scores, patients with high VRK1 or VRK2 expression in the TCGA, ICGC, and GSE14520 cohorts had poorer outcomes. Moreover, patients with a high VRK score in the TCGA, ICGC, and GSE14520 cohorts also had poorer outcomes. Importantly, Cox analysis revealed that the VRK score was a potential independent risk factor for HCC. Notably, TIMER2.0 and TIDE suggested that patients with high VRK scores had higher immune checkpoint response rates. Similarly, drug sensitivity analyses suggested that patients with high VRK scores were more resistant to sorafenib, paclitaxel, cisplatin, and gemcitabine. Finally, experimental validation revealed that VRK2 knockdown inhibited HCC development in vitro and in vivo. CONCLUSION: The VRK score was found to be a reliable indicator for predicting HCC prognosis and therapeutic efficacy. VRK2 is a potential therapeutic target for HCC.

10.1186/s12986-025-01011-1	Vitamin D and bone health: from physiological function to disease association.	Liu Y, Wang W, Yang Y, Deng J, Zhang Z	Vitamin D (VD) is a pleiotropic secosteroid hormone with well-established roles in calcium homeostasis, bone metabolism, and emerging functions in immune regulation, inflammation, and chronic disease modulation. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive summary of the current research on the significance of VD for bone health, with emphasis on its mechanism of action and its clinical significance in bone health. This review starts with an overview of VD metabolism, with emphasis on the enzyme transformation of vitamin D3 (VD3) and vitamin D2 (VD2) into the active 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1α,25(OH)(2)D) and their genomic and non-genomic signaling pathways through the Vitamin D receptor (VDR). Then, we discuss how VDR polymorphisms affect disease susceptibility and the dual role of VD in promoting innate immunity as well as inhibiting over-adaptive immunity. Our main focus is placed on VD's involvement in bone destruction diseases, including osteoarthritis (OA), osteoporosis (OP), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and bone tuberculosis. For OA, there is conflicting evidence on whether VD supplementation reduces cartilage degradation or pain. In OP, vitamin D deficiency aggravates bone loss, but the effectiveness of supplementation is dependent on baseline and calcium supplementation. For RA, the immunomodulatory effects of VD may decrease the activity of the disease, whereas in tuberculosis, VD increases the clearance of macrophage-mediated mycobacterial clearance, although the clinical study data are still inconclusive. This review underscores VD as a critical mediator of bone-immune crosstalk while calling for rigorous translational research to clarify its therapeutic potential across diverse diseases.

However, it remains unclear how cells translate oxidative stress signals into adaptive mitophagy responses. Here, we show that mtROS act as signaling molecules that activate the ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM)-cell cycle checkpoint kinase 2 (CHK2), a DNA damage response (DDR) pathway. When activated, CHK2 regulates three critical steps in mitophagy. First, CHK2 phosphorylates mitochondrial membrane protein ATAD3A at Ser371, which inhibits the transport of PINK1 to the inner mitochondrial membrane and leads to the accumulation of PINK1 and the commencement of mitophagy. Second, activated CHK2 targets the autophagy adaptor OPTN at Ser177 and Ser473, thereby enhancing the targeting of ubiquitinated mitochondria to autophagosomes. Finally, CHK2 phosphorylates Beclin 1 at Ser90 and Ser93, hence promoting the formation of autophagosomal membranes. Consistent with these effects, Chk2(-/-) mice show impaired mitophagic induction and impaired recovery in a ROS-dependent model of renal ischemia-reperfusion. Our study reveals a mtROS-triggered adaptive pathway that coordinates mitophagic induction, in order to protect cells and tissues exposed to pathophysiological stress-induced damage.

10.1096/fj.202502040R	The Impact of Dietary Patterns on the Human Gut Microbiome and Its Health	Muigano MN, Liu J, Liu X, Luo P, Li Z, Li J	The gut microbiome constitutes a dynamic and complex ecosystem within the human body, playing a crucial role in maintaining metabolic homeostasis, immune regulation, and disease prevention. Among the various factors shaping this ecosystem, dietary patterns represent a major determinant of microbial composition and function. Recent studies have identified dietary patterns as one of the primary factors influencing the composition and function of the gut microbiome. This review summarizes the effects of various dietary patterns, including the Mediterranean diet, vegetarianism, low-carbohydrate high-fat diets, and high-protein diets, on gut microbiome dynamics. Furthermore, it explores the mechanisms by which the gut microbiome contributes to the pathophysiology of multiple chronic diseases, such as obesity, diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease, osteoporosis, and neurodegenerative disorders. The potential of dietary interventions to improve health by modulating the gut microbiome is also evaluated, emphasizing recent findings that unveil the intricate network of dietary microbiome-host interactions. This review aims to provide a scientific basis for the development of future dietary strategies that leverage gut microbiome modulation, ultimately contributing to personalized nutrition and precision medicine.

Tear secretion is regulated by the sympathetic and parasympathetic components of the autonomic nervous system, although the contribution of each component is not fully understood. To investigate LG innervation, we identified sympathetic and parasympathetic postganglionic nerves, specifically innervating the mouse LG, by injecting a retrograde neuronal tracer into the LG. Interruption of neural stimuli to the LG by the denervation of these postganglionic nerves immediately and chronically decreased tear secretion, leading to LG atrophy along with destruction of the lobular structure. This investigation also found that parasympathetic, but not sympathetic, innervation was involved in these alterations.	The American journal of pathology	01/05/2020

Here we show that CA-enriched DNA fragments resulting from DNA-damaging chemotherapy in MSH2-low tumors preferentially bind cGAS with strong affinity and form biomolecular condensates by phase separation in the cytoplasm, resulting in antitumor immunity. However, classical CA-poor DNAs released from MSH2-high tumor cells engage AIM2, resulting in immunosuppression by upregulating PD-L1 and IDO. Intratumoral administration of CA-rich DNA fragments enhanced antitumor immunity in syngrafted PyMT tumors. Clinically, CA-rich DNA abundance in breast cancer following chemotherapy was associated with increased tumor-antigen-reactive T cells and better chemotherapeutic responses. Therefore, different tumor DNA fragments can trigger opposing immune responses depending on their preference for differential sensors. This study highlights another mechanistic link between genome instability and immune modulation and the therapeutic potential of CA-rich DNAs to enhance antitumor immunity.

Herein, we first identify that glioma patients exhibit a distinct gut microbial profile characterized by reduced butyrate-producing bacteria abundance, particularly R. faecis, along with decreased butyrate levels. Notably, KD reshapes the gut microbiota especially enriching A. muciniphila in a mucin-2-dependent manner, elevates butyrate production, and activates caspase-3 in microglia. These changes promote an anti-tumor microglial phenotype, ultimately suppressing glioma progression in mice. Crucially, KD's anti-glioma effect is notably abolished by antibiotics treatment; germ-free condition; or specific depletion of mucin-2, microglia, or microglial caspase-3. Furthermore, butyrate, A. muciniphila, R. faecis, or A. muciniphila plus R. faecis restores KD-induced microglial caspase-3 activation and the anti-tumor phenotype of microglia in antibiotics-treated or germ-free mice. These findings highlight that targeting the gut microbiota by KD or supplementing with butyrate could be an effective strategy for glioma therapy.	Cancer cell	25/09/2025
10.1007/s10265-015-0705-z	Molecular and physiological mechanisms regulating tissue reunion in incised plant	Asahina M, Satoh S	Interactions among the functionally specialized organs of higher plants ensure that the plant body develops and functions properly in response to changing environmental conditions. When an incision or grafting procedure interrupts the original organ or tissue connection, cell division is induced and tissue reunion occurs to restore physiological connections. Such activities have long been observed in grafting techniques, which are advantageous not only for agriculture and horticulture but also for basic research. To understand how this healing process is controlled and how this process is initiated and regulated at the molecular level, physiological and molecular analyses of tissue reunion have been performed using incised hypocotyls of cucumber (Cucumis sativus) and tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) and incised flowering stems of Arabidopsis thaliana. Our results suggest that leaf gibberellin and microelements from the roots are required for tissue reunion in the cortex of the cucumber and tomato incised hypocotyls. In addition, the wound-inducible hormones ethylene and jasmonic acid contribute to the regulation of the tissue reunion process in the upper and lower parts, respectively, of incised Arabidopsis stems. Ethylene and jasmonic acid modulate the expression of ANAC071 and RAP2.6L, respectively, and auxin signaling via ARF6/8 is essential for the expression of these transcription factors. In this report, we discuss recent findings regarding molecular and physiological mechanisms of the graft union and the tissue reunion process in wounded tissues of plants.

Cellular senescence is triggered by various stresses, in particular excessive shortening of telomeres, which activates the p21 pathway and leads to the arrest of the cell cycle. We used the mouse model p21(+/Tert) expressing TERT from the Cdkn1a locus to investigate whether counteracting telomere shortening by telomerase (TERT) specifically in pre-senescent cells could improve obesity-induced metabolic disorders. RESULTS: Our study demonstrates that conditional expression of TERT reduces insulin-resistance and glucose intolerance associated with obesity. In AT, this is accompanied by a decrease in the number of senescent p21-positive cells, very short telomeres, and oxidative DNA damage. Single nucleus RNA-seq data reveal TERT expression attenuates senescence induced by HFD in particular in adipose stem and progenitor cells (ASPC). We demonstrate that ASPC expansion and differentiation are promoted in p21(+/Tert) obese mice, thereby improving AT plasticity. Furthermore, we show that TERT expression enhances mitochondrial function and alleviates oxidative stress in ASPC. This process contributes to the AT hyperplasia with increased number of adipocytes which has been shown to have a protective effect against obesity-associated metabolic disorders CONCLUSIONS: These results underscore TERT's role in mitigating obesity-related metabolic dysfunction. Conditional TERT expression may therefore represent as a promising therapeutic strategy for obesity-associated metabolic disorders.	Molecular metabolism	03/10/2025

10.1148/radiol.233057	Amplifying Research: The Potential for Podcasts to Boost Radiology Journal	Wang M, Le T, Leswick DA	Background Podcasts have become an increasingly popular method of communicating information in medicine, including in radiology. However, the effect of podcasts on the reach of journal articles remains unclear. Purpose To evaluate the influence of Radiology podcasts on the performance metrics, including downloads, citations, and Altmetric Attention Score (AAS), of Radiology articles. Materials and Methods This was a retrospective study. All articles published in the print version of Radiology from January 2021 to December 2022 were reviewed; editorials and case reports were excluded. Articles featured on Radiology podcasts were included in the podcast group. Articles published within the same journal issue and category were the nonpodcast group. Downloads, Google Scholar citations, Dimensions citations, and AAS metrics were recorded. The Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare medians and evaluate differences between older and more recently published articles. Results The podcast group, composed of 88 articles, exhibited significantly higher median values for downloads (PG, 4521.0; nonpodcast group, 2123.0; P < .001), Google Scholar citations (podcast group, 14.5; nonpodcast group, 10.0; P = .01), Dimensions citations (podcast group, 12.0; nonpodcast group, 9.0; P = .01), and AAS (podcast group, 43.0; nonpodcast group, 10.0; P < .001) compared with the nonpodcast group of 378 articles. Within both groups, articles published in the earlier nonpodcast group (January to June 2021) had higher downloads (podcast group, P = .08; nonpodcast group, P < .001), Google Scholar citations (podcast group and nonpodcast group, P < .001), and Dimension citations (podcast group and nonpodcast group, P < .001) than articles from the later period (July to December 2022). AAS markedly increased in recent podcast articles (P = .03), but AAS for nonpodcast articles significantly decreased over time (P = .01). Conclusion Radiology articles featured on the Radiology podcast had greater median metrics, including downloads, Google Scholar citations, Dimensions citations, and AAS, compared with nonpodcast articles, suggesting that podcasts can be an effective method of disseminating and amplifying research within the field of radiology. © RSNA, 2024 See also the editorial by Chu and Nicola in this issue.

Whole genome sequencing (WGS) as a first diagnostic approach is expected to achieve a higher diagnostic yield than the French national reference strategies (RefStrategy) (fragile X expansion testing, chromosomal microarray analysis, and 44 ID genes panel), given its broad and more homogeneous coverage, its ability to identify copy number, structural and intergenic/deep intronic events. METHODS: DEFIDIAG is a national, prospective pilot investigation, carried out in the framework of the French initiative for genomic medicine (Plan France Médecine Génomique 2025), aimed at comparing the diagnostic yield of WGS trio analysis (WGS-trio) (index case, father, mother) with the RefStrategy in real-life conditions of clinical and laboratory workflows. Both strategies were applied in a blinded fashion in 1239 ID probands (50% were already-tested, 50% were never-tested) with no definitive genetic diagnosis. Among them, a subgroup of 187 patients were randomized to undergo WGS-solo (proband only) in addition to WGS-trio and RefStrategy. RESULTS: Four hundred forty two likely pathogenic/pathogenic single-nucleotide variants were identified (for 231 genes) as well as 171 variants of uncertain significance warranting clinical or functional reassessment for a potential reclassification (VUS +) (for 142 genes), 79 likely pathogenic/pathogenic copy number variants and 10 likely pathogenic/pathogenic structural variants. The diagnostic yield for likely pathogenic/pathogenic variants increased from 17.3% with the RefStrategy to 41.9% with WGS-trio in the never-tested patient cohort. An increase of 13.9% was observed in all categories by adding the VUS + , thus raising the yield to 56% for WGS-trio. Overall,	Genome medicine	03/10/2025

A key contributor to elevated GTP levels in tumors is inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase 2 (IMPDH2), a rate-limiting enzyme in the de novo guanine nucleotide biosynthetic pathway. Although IMPDH inhibitors, mycophenolic acid (MPA) and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), have shown potential in cancer therapies, their success has been limited due to their immunosuppressive side effects and several unresolved regulatory mechanisms, including paradoxical control of IMPDH activity by GTP. This review provides a systematic summary of the current understanding of IMPDH biology, emphasizing its complex regulation and therapeutic relevance in cancer. We will outline key unresolved questions, including isozyme-specific roles and mechanisms for escaping regulation, and propose mechanistic and translational strategies to design IMPDH-targeted cancer therapies.

10.1186/s12929-025-01188-w	The impacts of different dietary restriction regimens on aging and longevity:	Ching TT, Hsu AL	Dietary restriction (DR) refers to a broad set of interventions that limit the intake of specific nutrients or overall food consumption, either in quantity or timing, without causing malnutrition. DR has long been considered the most robust intervention for increasing healthspan and lifespan. This includes, not exhaustively, caloric restriction (CR), protein restriction (PR), amino acid restriction (AAR), intermittent fasting (IF), and time-restricted fasting (TRF), each with overlapping but distinct metabolic and physiological effects. This brief review examines the current scientific understanding of how some of the most commonly employed DR regimens may impact metabolism, lifespan, and healthspan. Particular attention is given to the underlying biological mechanisms and supporting evidence derived from both human clinical studies and fundamental biological research conducted with model organisms ranging from yeast to non-human primates.

This study aimed to evaluate the causal effects of dietary macronutrient composition on MRH. METHODS: Data on the four relative macronutrients intake and seven MRH outcomes were obtained from large genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and FinnGen Biobank. Multiple MR (Mendelian Randomization) methods were utilized in our study, including inverse variance weighted (IVW), MR-Egger, weighted median (WM), and MR-pleiotropy residual sum and outlier (MR-PRESSO). RESULTS: Our results revealed that a higher relative intake of carbohydrates (RC) was associated with a reduced risk of erectile dysfunction [OR = 0.43; CI = 0.18-1.00; p = 0.0049]. Additionally, a higher relative intake of fat was observed to be a risk factor for abnormal spermatozoa [OR = 19.98; CI = 1.16-345.25; p = 0.039]. The relative intake of sugar (RS) was positively correlated with levels of bioavailable testosterone [OR = 1.23; CI = 1.03-1.47; p = 0.022]. CONCLUSION: These findings contribute to the evidence of a causal relationship between four relative macronutrients intake and MRH. However, further confirmation of these causal effects through clinical trials is warranted.	The aging male : the official journal of the International Society for the Study	01/12/2025
10.1155/crp/9292002	The Relationship Between the Fibrinogen-to-Albumin Ratio and Short-Term Mortality	Guo LL, Liu P, Cai LN, Hu L, Zhou YS	Background: Recent studies have identified an association between the fibrinogen-to-albumin ratio (FAR) and the prognosis of coronary heart disease; however, evidence regarding its significance in heart failure patients remains limited. This study aims to examine the relationship between the FAR and short-term mortality among individuals with heart failure. Methods: In this retrospective cohort study, we conducted an analysis of clinical data from patients with heart failure who were hospitalized at Zigong Fourth People's Hospital from December 2016 to June 2019. The primary exposure variable was the FAR, while the outcomes of interest were mortality rates at 28 days and 3 months. Multivariate logistic regression evaluated FAR's independent association with short-term mortality, with predictive accuracy assessed via ROC curves and subgroup consistency through stratified analyses. Furthermore, smooth curve fitting was utilized to investigate the linear relationship, and a series of sensitivity analyses were conducted to validate the robustness of the findings. Results: The analysis included 1880 participants, of whom 58.1% were females and 54.1% were aged 60-80 years. Our study showed that a one standard deviation rise in the FAR was linked to a 45% increase in 28-day mortality (OR = 1.45, 95% CI = 1.02-2.06, p=0.04) after adjusting for potential confounding factors. The 28-day mortality rate was markedly elevated in the high FAR group (FAR > 0.126) compared to the low FAR group (OR = 4.01, 95% CI = 1.17-13.82, p=0.028). Comparable findings were noted at the 3-month mark. There were no significant interactions found in the subgroup analysis. A linear association was identified between FAR and short-term mortality. The optimal FAR cutoff value for predicting 28-day mortality was 0.156 (sensitivity 68.0%, specificity 59.4%, AUC = 0.654), while for 3-month mortality, it was 0.156 (sensitivity 68.0%, specificity 58.3%, AUC = 0.647). Sensitivity analyses corroborated the robustness of our findings. Conclusion: A positive correlation exists between the FAR and short-term mortality among Chinese patients with heart failure. These findings underscore the necessity for further investigation into the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms and potential therapeutic interventions associated with FAR in the context of heart failure.

10.1038/s41569-025-01211-5	Takotsubo syndrome: pathophysiological insights and innovations in patient care.	Omerovic E, Redfors B	Takotsubo syndrome, also known as broken heart syndrome, was first described in Japan in the 1990s and presents as acute heart failure caused by transient contractile dysfunction that mimics acute coronary syndrome but is not caused by acute coronary obstruction. Takotsubo syndrome accounts for as much as 2-3% of suspected coronary syndromes and is considerably more common in women than in men. In this Review, we discuss the historical background and clinical features of Takotsubo syndrome and our evolving understanding of its pathophysiology. The hallmark feature of Takotsubo syndrome is transient left ventricular dysfunction linked to emotional or physical stressors. Despite advances in our understanding of the clinical presentation and possible pathophysiological mechanisms of Takotsubo syndrome, this condition continues to challenge our fundamental understanding of human anatomy and physiology, particularly regarding how acute emotional and physical stressors can trigger such profound cardiovascular dysfunction. Although the definitive mechanisms remain elusive, current hypotheses largely centre on catecholamine surges and sympathetic nervous system hyperactivation. Diagnostic criteria have been developed by the Mayo Clinic and European Society of Cardiology working groups but, in the absence of randomized controlled clinical trials, no specific treatments for Takotsubo syndrome are available. In this Review, we highlight the complex pathophysiology of Takotsubo syndrome, with an emphasis on the interplay between emotional stress and cardiac health, and call for the development of evidence-based management protocols.

Transcranial temporal interference stimulation (tTIS), a novel and noninvasive approach for targeting deep brain structures, was investigated for its efficacy and safety in BD-D patients in this trial. Thirty-six patients were recruited for a single-arm, open-label trial, and 25 completed the 5-day intervention consisting of 10 tTIS sessions targeting the left nucleus accumbens. Each session lasted 20 min, with a maximum current intensity of 2 mA and an envelope stimulation frequency of 40 Hz. Significant symptom reductions were observed following treatment, with mean HAMD-17 scores decreasing from 23.36 to 16.16 (p < 0.0001), MADRS scores from 39.12 to 31.28 (p < 0.01), HAMA scores from 19.68 to 15.44 (p < 0.05), and QIDS scores from 13.52to 9.68 (p < 0.001). Eleven participants (44.0%) met improvement criteria and seven (28.0%) achieved response. Cognitive assessments indicated improvements in memory and executive function, and changes in reward-related brain activity correlated positively with symptom reduction. Adverse events were mild, mainly transient scalp discomfort. These findings provide preliminary evidence supporting the efficacy and safety of tTIS for alleviating depressive symptoms and cognitive impairments in BD-D.	Molecular psychiatry	02/10/2025
10.1002/mds.70070	A Biomarker-Based Classification of Corticobasal Syndrome.	Palleis C, Bernhardt AM, Weidinger E, Fietzek UM, Jäck A, Katzdobler S, Gnörich J, Bauer T, Franzmeier N, Perneczky R, Brendel M, Levin J, Höglinger GU	BACKGROUND: Corticobasal syndrome (CBS) is a clinically defined syndrome with progressive movement and cortical dysfunction, caused by various underlying pathologies, most commonly tau-predominant pathologies such as progressive supranuclear palsy and corticobasal degeneration, or Alzheimer's disease (AD). Lewy-type α-synucleinopathies (LTS), TDP-43 proteinopathies, and mixed pathologies may also underlie CBS. The clinical impact of these pathologies remains poorly understood. OBJECTIVES: To subclassify CBS patients in vivo using biomarkers for amyloid-β (Aβ), Tau, and α-synuclein (αSyn), and assess the clinical relevance of this stratification. METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study of 50 CBS patients at LMU University Hospital Munich. Biomarker analysis included cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Aβ42 and Aβ42/40, [(18)F]flutemetamol Aβ-PET, [(18)F]PI-2620 tau-PET, and αSyn seed amplification assays in CSF. CSF neurofilament light chain (NfL) served as a marker of neurodegeneration. Patients were stratified into six groups based on biomarker positivity. RESULTS: Tau positivity was found in 90% of CBS cases, Aβ in 28%, and αSyn in 24%. Stratification identified: 52% consistent with tau-predominant pathology, 18% with AD, 10% with AD+LTS, 10% with tau-predominant+LTS, 4% with isolated LTS, and 6% unclassified. αSyn positivity was more frequent in AD-CBS (36%) than in tau-predominant-CBS (16%). Aβ-positive cases showed greater cognitive impairment; Tau positivity correlated with worse motor symptoms; αSyn-positive patients had milder motor symptoms, slower progression, and lower NfL levels. CONCLUSIONS: CBS is molecularly heterogeneous. Biomarker-based classification may enhance diagnostic precision and support personalized therapeutic strategies. © 2025 The Author(s).

10.4168/aair.2025.17.5.531	An Overview of Chronic Spontaneous Urticaria: Diagnosis, Management, and	Tbakhi B, Ware K, Park HS, Bernstein JS, Bernstein JA	Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) is a complex mast cell-driven disorder characterized by recurrent pruritic wheals and/or angioedema lasting over 6 weeks. This condition affects women more frequently than men, particularly between the ages of 20 and 40, and imposes considerable physical, psychological, and economic burdens, with annual healthcare costs in the U.S exceeding $200 million. Current management strategies emphasize a stepwise approach, initiating with the escalating doses of second-generation antihistamines, followed by biologics such as omalizumab or now dupilumab, and prescribing cyclosporine to refractory cases. Emerging therapies targeting specific endotypes of CSU, including Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitors and mast cell depleting agents, present new avenues for personalized treatment. Furthermore, validated patient-reported outcome measures and digital tools like the CRUSE application enhance symptom tracking and facilitate patient-physician communication. As the therapeutic landscape for CSU evolves, a focus on individualized, evidence-based care approaches is critical to optimizing patient outcomes. Future research priorities include identifying biomarkers predictive of treatment response, conducting long-term outcome studies, and evaluating treatment tapering strategies to achieve sustained remission. Addressing cost-effectiveness and accessibility of new therapies will be pivotal in ensuring equitable management of CSU across diverse populations. Ultimately, it is the goal that a comprehensive understanding of CSU's heterogeneity, with tailored therapeutic strategies, will significantly improve patient quality of life and outcomes.

10.1186/s12967-025-07075-0	Macrophage polarization in diabetic vascular complications: mechanistic insights	Cao L, Ding L, Xia Q, Zhang Z, Li M, Song S, Yin K, Li Z, Li X, Wang Z, Zhao D, Li X, Wang Z	Diabetes mellitus, particularly type 2 diabetes mellitus, is a widespread chronic metabolic disorder characterized by persistent hyperglycemia and low-grade chronic inflammation. This sustained inflammatory state is a major driver of both macrovascular and microvascular complications. Among immune cells, macrophages play a central role as effectors and regulators of chronic inflammation. In the diabetic milieu, they respond to diverse microenvironmental cues and polarize into distinct functional phenotypes, thereby contributing to both the progression and potential resolution of diabetes-associated vascular damage. This review examines the mechanisms of macrophage polarization in diabetic vascular complications, elucidates key signaling pathways and their interactions with metabolic dysfunction, and summarizes current regulatory strategies and emerging therapeutic targets. Particular emphasis is placed on recent pharmacological approaches that modulate macrophage polarization, highlighting their potential as novel strategies to delay or prevent the onset and progression of vascular complications in diabetes.

10.1016/j.jhep.2025.09.022	Targeting cell-state plasticity driven by FOXM1/CEBPB axis disrupts developmental	Zhang XF, Zuo XY, Zhu Y, Li JX, Xian JS, Zhang WX, Cheng W, Yuan J, Gong YF, Tang H, Yang XQ, Su YY, Zhang CY, Liu SS, Huang L, Wang H, Li MM, Xi SY, Tang YQ, Zhou L, Wah Lee TK, Ma S, Guan XY, Ma NF, Zhang Y, Liu M	BACKGROUND & AIMS: Heterogeneous cellular states traverse the developmental hierarchy induced by phenotypic plasticity and are emerging as key drivers of therapeutic resistance in HCC. However, the factors governing this developmental heterogeneity are not clear, and therapeutic interventions are lacking. METHODS: Autoregulatory network analysis was performed on public datasets of bulk RNA-seq and scRNA-seq data from patients with HCC, as well as on our hepatocyte differentiation model, to identify key transcriptional regulators governing the transition of cellular states during hepatic differentiation. In vitro and in vivo models were used to investigate molecular mechanisms and evaluate therapeutic potential. RESULTS: We demonstrate dynamic cell-state transitions with chaotic developmental trajectories in the malignant progression of hepatocellular carcinoma. High developmental diversity is closely linked to the activation of drug resistance genes and immune evasion, significantly affecting patient prognosis. We identify that the FOXM1/CEBPB axis at the apex controls developmental heterogeneity dynamics. They form a master decision toggle switch by mutually suppressing each other and competing for control over downstream state-specific networks. Inhibiting FOXM1 restores tumor developmental homogeneity, exposing tumor cells back to immune surveillance. The likely mechanism is the activation of IFN-γ signaling and antigen presentation. A GalNAc-conjugated, chemically modified siRNA lead compound targeting hepatic FOXM1 is designed and shows strong potency and tolerability in therapeutic mouse models. CONCLUSION: Tumor cell-state plasticity driven by the FOXM1/CEBPB axis induces developmental heterogeneity and therapeutic resistance in hepatocellular carcinoma. RNAi-based therapies targeting hepatic FOXM1 showed strong potential for further clinical testing. IMPACT AND IMPLICATIONS: Tumor heterogeneity and therapeutic resistance remain major barriers in cancer treatment, largely driven by dynamic transitions across multiple cellular states. This study reveals that the FOXM1/CEBPB axis is a crucial regulator of these hierarchical cellular transitions and plays a key role in sustaining developmental heterogeneity and promoting resistance to therapies. By targeting this axis, we demonstrated the restoration of developmental homogeneity and significant disruption of therapeutic resistance in preclinical models. Furthermore, our findings highlight the strong efficacy of RNAi-based therapeutics directed at hepatic FOXM1, highlighting their promising potential as pioneering small nucleic acid drugs for cancer therapy.

10.7326/ANNALS-24-01863	Association Between Body Composition and Cardiometabolic Outcomes : A Prospective	Jung M, Reisert M, Rieder H, Rospleszcz S, Lu MT, Bamberg F, Raghu VK, Weiss J	BACKGROUND: Current measures of adiposity have limitations. Artificial intelligence (AI) models may accurately and efficiently estimate body composition (BC) from routine imaging. OBJECTIVE: To assess the association of AI-derived BC compartments from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with cardiometabolic outcomes. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: UK Biobank (UKB) observational cohort study. PARTICIPANTS: 33 432 UKB participants with no history of diabetes, myocardial infarction, or ischemic stroke (mean age, 65.0 years [SD, 7.8]; mean body mass index [BMI], 25.8 kg/m(2) [SD, 4.2]; 52.8% female) who underwent whole-body MRI. MEASUREMENTS: An AI tool was applied to MRI to derive 3-dimensional (3D) BC measures, including subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT), visceral adipose tissue (VAT), skeletal muscle (SM), and SM fat fraction (SMFF), and then calculate their relative distribution. Sex-stratified associations of these relative compartments with incident diabetes mellitus (DM) and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) were assessed using restricted cubic splines. RESULTS: Adipose tissue compartments and SMFF increased and SM decreased with age. After adjustment for age, smoking, and hypertension, greater adiposity and lower SM proportion were associated with higher incidence of DM and MACE after a median follow-up of 4.2 years in sex-stratified analyses; however, after additional adjustment for BMI and waist circumference (WC), only elevated VAT proportions and high SMFF (top fifth percentile in the cohort for each) were associated with increased risk for DM (respective adjusted hazard ratios [aHRs], 2.16 [95% CI, 1.59 to 2.94] and 1.27 [CI, 0.89 to 1.80] in females and 1.84 [CI, 1.48 to 2.27] and 1.84 [CI, 1.43 to 2.37] in males) and MACE (1.37 [CI, 1.00 to 1.88] and 1.72 [CI, 1.23 to 2.41] in females and 1.22 [CI, 0.99 to 1.50] and 1.25 [CI, 0.98 to 1.60] in males). In addition, in males only, those in the bottom fifth percentile of SM proportion had increased risk for DM (aHR for the bottom fifth percentile of the cohort, 1.96 [CI, 1.45 to 2.65]) and MACE (aHR, 1.55 [CI, 1.15 to 2.09]). LIMITATION: Results may not be generalizable to non-Whites or people outside the United Kingdom. CONCLUSION: Artificial intelligence-derived BC proportions were strongly associated with cardiometabolic risk, but after BMI and WC were accounted for, only VAT proportion and SMFF (both sexes) and SM proportion (males only) added prognostic information.

10.1016/j.celrep.2025.116384	Spliceosome inhibition induces Z-RNA and ZBP1-driven cell death in small cell	Jiang X, Ma X, Zhou Y, Liu X, Zhang T, Kim W, Balachandran S, Cañadas I	Spliceosome inhibitors emerged as promising anticancer agents. Recent studies have demonstrated that spliceosome-targeted therapies (STTs) trigger antitumor immune responses by inducing the accumulation of right-handed double-stranded (ds)RNA (A-RNA), resulting in the activation of RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs) and type I interferon-driven antiviral responses. Here, we show that spliceosome inhibition by pharmacological or genetic neutralization of SF3B1 activity induces the accumulation of endogenous left-handed dsRNAs (Z-RNAs) derived from intron-retained RNAs. These Z-RNAs activate the Z-form nucleic acid-sensor ZBP1, which triggers cell death in mouse embryonic fibroblasts and small cell lung cancer (SCLC) cells. Spliceosome inhibition induced potent ZBP1-dependent cell death in cancer-associated fibroblasts, which was essential for enhancing immunotherapy response in mouse models of SCLC. Collectively, these results demonstrate that spliceosome inhibitors can be used to generate Z-RNA and trigger on-demand ZBP1-dependent cell death in cells of the tumor microenvironment (TME) as a therapeutic strategy to enhance immunotherapy responses in resistant cancers.

10.1016/j.phymed.2025.157341	Juglone promotes spinal cord injury recovery by suppressing pyroptosis and	Chen L, Chang Y, Zhang S, Wang Z, Liu H, Wang H, Shi L, Li N, Feng S	BACKGROUND: Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a central nervous system (CNS) disorder, and it often results in severe neuronal damage. However, there are still no effective treatments for SCI, so it is important to explore and identify effective therapeutic strategies. As a natural compound extracted from walnuts, juglone has been previously reported to exhibit various biological activities, including anti-tumor and anti-inflammatory effects, but the effects on central nerve system are still blank. PURPOSE: This study aims to evaluate the therapeutic effects of juglone in spinal cord injury and elucidate its molecular mechanisms in neuroprotection. STUDY DESIGN: In vitro neuronal OGD/R experiments and in vivo spinal cord injury model experiments were employed to investigate the neuroprotective effects of juglone on neurons. METHODS: Neuronal OGD/R models and spinal cord injury models were used to detect the neuroprotective effect of juglone. Immunofluorescence, Western Blot and ELISA were employed to investigate the effects of juglone on necroptosis and pyroptosis of neurons. RNA-Seq analysis, immunoprecipitation, Western Blot, qRT-PCR, immunofluorescence and ChIP-qPCR were utilized to elucidate the molecular mechanism of its neuroprotective effect. RESULTS: Juglone can inhibit necroptosis and pyroptosis both in vivo and in vitro, thereby exerting neuroprotective effects. Mechanistically, we identify a novel FOS/USP53 signaling axis, in which juglone suppresses the expression of FOS that directly regulates the deubiquitinating enzyme USP53. Reduced FOS expression leads to the downregulation of USP53, thereby promoting the ubiquitination and degradation of MLKL and GSDMD. This cascade ultimately alleviates necroptosis and pyroptosis in injured neurons. CONCLUSION: Juglone is a potential neuroprotective drug that exerts its effect by inhibiting necroptosis and pyroptosis through the FOS/USP53/ubiquitination signaling axis. These findings provide a novel potential drug target for the treatment of spinal cord injury.	Phytomedicine : international journal of phytotherapy and phytopharmacology	27/09/2025

We developed TriVerity, which uses isothermal amplification of 29 mRNAs and machine learning algorithms on the Myrna instrument to determine likelihoods of bacterial infection, viral infection and need for critical care interventions within 7 days. To validate TriVerity, the SEPSIS-SHIELD study enrolled 1,222 patients with clinically adjudicated infection status and need for critical care intervention within 7 days as endpoints. The TriVerity Bacterial and Viral scores had higher accuracy than C-reactive protein, procalcitonin or white blood cell count for the diagnosis of bacterial infection with area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) of 0.83, and viral infection (AUROC = 0.91). The TriVerity Severity score had an AUROC of 0.78 for predicting illness severity and allowed reclassification of risk for critical care interventions compared to clinical assessment (quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment) alone. Each of the three scores had rule-in specificity >92% and rule-out sensitivity >95%. Comparison of antibiotics administration at presentation with post-follow-up adjudication found that TriVerity could potentially reduce false positives and false negatives for inappropriate antibiotics use by 60-70%. Further clinical testing in an interventional setting is needed to prove actionability and clinical benefit of TriVerity.	Nature medicine	30/09/2025

These large end-stage species are formed by smaller soluble protein nanoscale assemblies, often termed oligomers, which are proposed as early drivers of pathogenesis. Until now, this hypothesis has remained controversial, at least in part because it has not been possible to directly visualize nanoscale assemblies in human brain tissue. Here we present Advanced Sensing of Aggregates-Parkinson's Disease, an imaging method to generate large-scale α-synuclein aggregate maps in post-mortem human brain tissue. We combined autofluorescence suppression with single-molecule fluorescence microscopy, which together enable the detection of nanoscale α-synuclein aggregates. To demonstrate the use of this platform, we analysed ~1.2 million nanoscale aggregates from the anterior cingulate cortex in human post-mortem brain samples from patients with PD and healthy controls. Our data reveal a disease-specific shift in a subpopulation of nanoscale assemblies that represent an early feature of the proteinopathy that underlies PD. We anticipate that quantitative information about this distribution provided by Advanced Sensing of Aggregates-Parkinson's Disease will enable mechanistic studies to reveal the pathological processes caused by α-synuclein aggregation.
