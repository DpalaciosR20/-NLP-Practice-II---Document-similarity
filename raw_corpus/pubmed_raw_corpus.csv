10.1016/j.cell.2025.08.038	Multiscale proteomic modeling reveals protein networks driving Alzheimer's	Wang E, Yu K, Cao J, Wang M, Katsel P, Song WM, Wang Z, Li Y, Wang X, Wang Q, Xu P, Yu G, Zhu L, Geng J, Habibi P, Qian L, Tuck T, Li A, Tcw J, Roussos P, Brennand KJ, Haroutunian V, Johnson ECB, Seyfried NT, Levey AI, Bennett DA, Peng J, Cai D, Zhang B	The molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common form of dementia, remain poorly understood. Proteomics offers a crucial approach to elucidating AD pathogenesis, as alterations in protein expression are more directly linked to phenotypic outcomes than changes at the genetic or transcriptomic level. In this study, we develop multiscale proteomic network models for AD by integrating large-scale matched proteomic and genetic data from brain regions vulnerable to the disease. These models reveal detailed protein interaction structures and identify putative key driver proteins (KDPs) involved in AD progression. Notably, the network analysis uncovers an	Cell	25/09/2025

Natural products are one of the important sources for development of drugs against NSCLC. Weifuchun is a traditional Chinese medicine formula that widely used in Chinese medicine hospitals for the treatment of gastric precancerous lesions. Glaucocalyxin A (GLA) is one of the particularly important active ingredients, which had a wide range of pharmacological activities, including antitumor, antifibrotic, and osteoprotective effects. However, despite these promising therapeutic potentials, the precise molecular mechanisms underlying GLA's activity against NSCLC and its cellular targets remain poorly characterized. PURPOSE: The objective of this study was to assess the role of GLA in anti-NSCLC and to further investigate its pharmacological effects. METHODS: A systematic evaluation of the anti-NSCLC effect of GLA was conducted by in vitro and in vivo experiments. Using activity-based protein profiling (ABPP) technology, we identified its molecular targets and elucidated the underlying mechanism. RESULTS: This study confirmed the significant inhibitory activity of GLA against NSCLC both in vitro and in vivo. More importantly, GLA selectively formed covalent bonds with Cys(173) of peroxiredoxin 1 (PRDX1) and Cys(59), Cys(64), Cys(497) and Sec(498) of thioredoxin reductase 1 (TXNRD1), and based on the computational chemistry to derive the covalent binding reactivity order of it (Sec(498) > Cys(59) > Cys(497) > Cys(64)). This dual-target inhibition significantly disrupted cellular redox homeostasis, leading to significant accumulation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). The resulting oxidative stress triggered the activation of autophagy pathways and ultimately induced ferroptosis in NSCLC cells. CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrated that GLA may target PRDX1 and TXNRD1 proteins, inhibiting their enzymatic activity. This action leads to excessive accumulation of intracellular ROS and ultimately inducing autophagy-mediated ferroptosis. This work not only delineated the novel molecular mechanism of GLA's anti-NSCLC effects, but also provided critical insights for the development of covalent inhibitors targeting redox-regulating proteins in cancer therapeutics.

Here, we demonstrate the presence of pseudo-synaptic connections between sensory nerve endings and cancer cells in an extracerebral cancer, i.e., pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). These synaptic sites exhibit a selective enrichment of the glutamatergic N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDA) receptor subunit NMDAR2D (GRIN2D) on the cancer cells, which turns PDAC cells responsive to neuron-derived glutamate and promotes tumor growth and spread. Intriguingly, neurons transform a subset of co-cultured PDAC cells into calcium-responsive cells via GRIN2D-type glutamate receptors at the neuron-cancer pseudo-synapses. We found that the expression of this subunit is due to the increased glutamate availability provided by sensory innervation in a neurotrophic feedforward loop. Moreover, interference with the glutamate-GRIN2D signaling at these neuron-cancer pseudo-synapses markedly improved survival in vivo. This discovery of peripheral cancer-neuron pseudo-synapses may provide an opportunity for cancer-neuroscience-instructed oncological therapies.	Cancer cell	25/09/2025

Herein, we first identify that glioma patients exhibit a distinct gut microbial profile characterized by reduced butyrate-producing bacteria abundance, particularly R. faecis, along with decreased butyrate levels. Notably, KD reshapes the gut microbiota especially enriching A. muciniphila in a mucin-2-dependent manner, elevates butyrate production, and activates caspase-3 in microglia. These changes promote an anti-tumor microglial phenotype, ultimately suppressing glioma progression in mice. Crucially, KD's anti-glioma effect is notably abolished by antibiotics treatment; germ-free condition; or specific depletion of mucin-2, microglia, or microglial caspase-3. Furthermore, butyrate, A. muciniphila, R. faecis, or A. muciniphila plus R. faecis restores KD-induced microglial caspase-3 activation and the anti-tumor phenotype of microglia in antibiotics-treated or germ-free mice. These findings highlight that targeting the gut microbiota by KD or supplementing with butyrate could be an effective strategy for glioma therapy.	Cancer cell	25/09/2025
10.1016/j.ceb.2025.102583	Dynamic regulation of cell death signaling.	Majoul A, Garcia-Saez AJ	There are many ways for a cell to die, but each cell only dies once, causing an inherent variability that results from common triggers activating interconnected signaling networks that diverge at key decision points during cell death initiation, progression, and execution. Despite the death of each cell being a unique biomolecular event, shared features allow us to categorize the process depending on the pathways activated and their outcomes. Here we outline core concepts about the dynamic interplay between cell death pathways, focusing on apoptosis, necroptosis, pyroptosis, and ferroptosis. We highlight unresolved decision points, including the dynamics of pore formation and the points of no return. We also discuss conceptual commonalities across systems and outline key recent developments that refine our understanding of the dynamic regulation of cell death.

10.1016/S0140-6736(25)01148-1	Oral iptacopan therapy in patients with C3 glomerulopathy: a randomised,	Kavanagh D, Bomback AS, Vivarelli M, Nester CM, Remuzzi G, Zhao MH, Wong EKS, Wang Y, Krishnan I, Schuhmann I, Trapani AJ, Webb NJA, Meier M, Israni RK, Smith RJH	BACKGROUND: C3 glomerulopathy is an ultra-rare, severe form of glomerulonephritis caused by overactivation of the alternative complement pathway. We aimed to assess efficacy and safety of iptacopan (LNP023), an oral, proximal complement inhibitor that targets factor B to selectively inhibit the alternative pathway of the complement cascade. METHODS: APPEAR-C3G was a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 study of iptacopan versus placebo (both in addition to supportive care [renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors] and immunosuppression). Adult participants (aged 18-60 years) with biopsy-confirmed C3 glomerulopathy were enrolled from 35 hospitals or medical centres in 18 countries. Inclusion criteria included reduced serum C3 concentration (ie, <77 mg/dL [defined as <0·85 × lower limit of the central laboratory normal range]) at screening, urine protein-creatinine ratio (UPCR) of 1·0 g/g or higher at day -75 and day -15 before randomisation, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 30 mL/min per 1·73 m(2) or higher at screening and day -15, and vaccination against Neisseria meningitidis and Streptococcus pneumoniae. All eligible participants were randomised 1:1 via interactive response technology to either the iptacopan or the placebo group, stratified by treatment with corticosteroids, mycophenolic acid, or both (yes or no). During the 6-month double-blind period, participants orally received either iptacopan 200 mg twice daily or placebo; this was followed by a 6-month open-label period in which all participants received iptacopan 200 mg twice daily. The primary endpoint was relative reduction in proteinuria (measured by log-transformed ratio to baseline in UPCR sampled from a 24-h urine collection) at 6 months. The primary analyses were done in the full analysis set (ie, all participants to whom study treatment was assigned by randomisation); all participants who received at least one dose of study treatment were included in the safety analysis. This trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04817618) and the adult cohort has been completed. FINDINGS: Between July 28, 2021, and Feb 15, 2023, 132 participants were screened, of whom 58 did not complete the screening period and 74 (64% male; 69% White) were randomised 1:1 to receive either iptacopan (n=38) or placebo (n=36). One participant in the placebo group discontinued treatment during the open-label period. The 24-h UPCR percentage change relative to baseline at 6 months was -30·2% (95% CI -42·8 to -14·8) in the iptacopan group and 7·6% (-11·9 to 31·3) in the placebo group. In the iptacopan group, the geometric mean of 24-h UPCR was 3·33 g/g (95% CI 2·79 to 3·97) at baseline and 2·17 g/g (1·62 to 2·91) at 6 months; in the placebo group, this was 2·58 g/g (2·18 to 3·05) at baseline and 2·80 g/g (2·37 to 3·30) at 6 months. The primary endpoint was met with a relative reduction in 24-h UPCR at 6 months for iptacopan versus placebo of 35·1% (13·8 to 51·1; p=0·0014). 30 (79%) of 38 participants in the iptacopan group had treatment-emergent adverse events, compared with 24 (67%) of 36 participants in the placebo group; most of these were of mild or moderate severity. There were no deaths, no treatment discontinuations due to treatment-emergent adverse events, and no meningococcal infections. Serious adverse events were reported in three (8%) participants in the iptacopan group and one (3%) participant in the placebo group. INTERPRETATION: Iptacopan showed a statistically significant, clinically meaningful proteinuria reduction in addition to RAAS inhibitors and immunosuppression at 6 months. Iptacopan was well tolerated with an acceptable safety profile in patients with C3 glomerulopathy. FUNDING: Novartis Pharma.	Lancet (London, England)	25/09/2025
10.1016/j.cmet.2025.09.001	Catenibacteriummitsuokai promotes hepatocellular carcinogenesis by binding to	Zhang Y, Liu W, Wong CC, Song Q, Zhang X, Zhou Q, Ren X, Ren X, Xuan R, Zhao Y, Xu L, Li X, Xu L, Zhang X, Kuang M, Yu J	The role of gut microbes in the pathogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unclear. Here, we identified that Catenibacterium is enriched in both the feces and tumors of patients with HCC. C. mitsuokai accelerated HCC carcinogenesis in both conventional and germ-free mice. Furthermore, C. mitsuokai disrupted the gut barrier and translocated to the liver as live bacteria. Critically, the C. mitsuokai surface protein Gtr1/RagA interacts with the γ-catenin receptor on HCC cells, facilitating its attachment and colonization in the mouse liver. We further revealed that the pro-tumorigenic effect of C. mitsuokai depends on its secreted metabolite, quinolinic acid. Mechanistically, quinolinic acid binds to and activates the tyrosine kinase with immunoglobulin and epidermal growth factor homology domains 2 (TIE2) on HCC cells. Phosphorylated TIE2 subsequently activates the downstream oncogenic phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/AKT) pathway, thereby promoting HCC progression. In summary, C. mitsuokai disrupts the gut barrier, colonizes HCC cells via Gtr1/RagA-γ-catenin, and secretes quinolinic acid, which binds to TIE2 and drives the PI3K/AKT pathway to promote HCC development.

10.1111/ppe.12615	Acetaminophen use during pregnancy and the risk of attention deficit	Masarwa R, Platt RW, Filion KB	BACKGROUND: The association between acetaminophen use during pregnancy and the development of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in the offspring may be due to bias. OBJECTIVES: The primary objective was to assess the role of potential unmeasured confounding in the estimation of the association between acetaminophen use during pregnancy and the risk of ADHD, through bias analysis. The secondary objective was to assess the roles of selection bias and exposure misclassification. DATA SOURCES: We searched MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library up to December 2018. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: We included observational studies examining the association between acetaminophen use during pregnancy and the risk of ADHD. SYNTHESIS: We meta-analysed data across studies, using random-effects model. We conducted a bias analysis to studies that did not adjust for important confounders, to explore systematic errors related to unmeasured confounding, selection bias, and exposure misclassification. RESULTS: The search resulted in seven studies included in our meta-analysis. When adjusted estimates were pooled across all studies, the risk ratio (RR) for ADHD was 1.35 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.25, 1.46; I(2) = 48%). Sensitivity analysis for unmeasured confounding in this meta-analysis showed that a confounder of 1.69 on the RR scale would reduce to 10% the proportion of studies with a true effect size of RR >1.10. Unmeasured confounding bias analysis decreased the point estimate in five of the seven studies and increased in two studies, suggesting that the observed association could be confounded by parental ADHD. Unadjusted and bias-corrected risk ratios (bcRRs) were: RR = 1.34, bcRR = 1.13; RR = 1.51, bcRR = 1.17; RR = 1.63, bcRR = 1.38; RR = 1.44, bcRR = 1.17; RR = 1.16, bcRR = 1.18; RR = 1.25, bcRR = 1.05; and RR = 0.99, bcRR = 1.18. CONCLUSIONS: Bias analysis suggests that the previously reported association between acetaminophen use during pregnancy and an increased risk of ADHD in the offspring may be due to unmeasured confounding. Our ability to conclude a causal association is limited.	Paediatric and perinatal epidemiology	01/05/2020
10.1183/13993003.01126-2025	European Respiratory Society Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of	Chalmers JD, Haworth CS, Flume P, Long MB, Burgel PR, Dimakou K, Blasi F, Herrero-Cortina B, Dhar R, Chotirmall SH, Ringshausen FC, Altenburg J, Morgan L, Nigro M, Crichton ML, Van Meel C, Sibila O, Timothy A, Kompatsiari E, Hedberg T, Vandendriessche T, McShane PJ, Tonia T, Winthrop K, Loebinger MR, Lorent N, Goeminne P, Shteinberg M, Polverino E, Aliberti S	BACKGROUND: Bronchiectasis is a common lung condition associated with wide range of infectious, immunological, autoimmune, allergic and genetic conditions. Exacerbations and daily symptoms have the largest impact on patients and healthcare systems, and they are the key focus of treatments. Current practice is heterogeneous globally, and bronchiectasis has historically been a neglected disease. Here, we present evidence-based international guidelines for the management of adults with bronchiectasis. METHODS: A European Respiratory Society (ERS) Task Force, comprising global experts, a methodologist, and patient representatives, developed clinical practice guidelines in accordance with ERS methodology and the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations) approach. Systematic literature searches, data extraction, and meta-analysis were performed to generate evidence tables, and recommendations were formulated using the evidence-to-decision framework. A total of 8 PICO (Patient, Intervention, Comparator, Outcomes) questions and 3 narrative questions were developed. RECOMMENDATIONS: The Task Force recommendations include strong recommendations in favour of airway clearance techniques for most patients with bronchiectasis and pulmonary rehabilitation for those with impaired exercise capacity. We issue a strong recommendation for the use of long-term macrolide treatment for patients at high risk of exacerbations and a strong recommendation in favour of long-term inhaled antibiotics in patients with chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection at high risk of exacerbation. Conditional recommendations support the use of eradication treatment or mucoactive drugs in specific circumstances. We suggest not to routinely use long term oral, non-macrolide antibiotic treatment or inhaled corticosteroids. Additional guidance is also provided on testing for underlying causes, managing exacerbations, and managing the deteriorating patient. CONCLUSION: The ERS bronchiectasis guidelines provide an evidence-based framework for optimal management of adults with bronchiectasis and serve as a benchmark for evaluating the quality of care. SCOPE AND OBJECTIVES: The European Respiratory Society (ERS) guidelines for the management of bronchiectasis in adults provide evidence-based recommendations for the care of people with clinically significant bronchiectasis, defined by the presence of permanent dilatation of the bronchi evident on chest CT scan, along with characteristic clinical symptoms. [1] These guidelines are intended for all healthcare professionals involved in the care of adults with bronchiectasis, as well as for policymakers, regulatory authorities, and pharmaceutical companies. Bronchiectasis is a complex and heterogeneous disease; therefore, no guideline can be entirely comprehensive or replace clinical judgement. All guideline recommendations must be interpreted within the specific clinical context in which they are applied. Separate ERS guidelines for the management of bronchiectasis in children exist [2]. Bronchiectasis due to cystic fibrosis (CF) has a distinct evidence base; therefore, guidance for the management of CF is provided elsewhere. [3] Some bronchiectasis-associated conditions also have distinct guidelines for investigation and management, such as primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) [4], allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) [5] and non-tuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) pulmonary disease [6]. While the present guidelines apply for these conditions, they should be interpreted in conjunction with the relevant syndrome-specific recommendations.	The European respiratory journal	28/09/2025
10.1016/j.chroma.2018.01.015	Profiling of polyunsaturated fatty acids in human serum using off-line and	Gu WY, Liu MX, Sun BQ, Guo MQ, Wu JL, Li N	Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) play a pivotal role in the biological effects, and are the potential biomarkers for some diseases. However, the structural diversity and similarity, the low concentration, and the interference of high abundant endogenous components challenge the PUFAs profiling. Herein, a novel analytical approach, off-line and on-line solid phase extraction-nano-liquid chromatography-quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (off-line and on-line SPE-nano-LC-Q-TOF-MS), was established to monitor the PUFAs. The combination of off-line and on-line SPE removed most of impurities, and the recoveries ranged from 80.1% to 93.0% and the matrix effects were from 85.1% to 92.8%. Using this method, 51 PUFAs could be separated well and quantified with the limits of quantification between 0.006 and 2.2 pg. Finally, this developed method was applied successfully to simultaneously qualify and quantify the potential biomarkers in the allergic patients. 21 PUFAs including LTB(4,) 5S-, 11S-, 15S-HETE and 15S-HEPE showed significant differences. Our study indicated that the established method has the potential to sensitively and accurately determine the PUFAs in biological samples.	Journal of chromatography. A	16/02/2018

Wray NR, Wijmenga C, Sullivan PF, Yang J, Visscher PM	"The evidence that most adult-onset common diseases have a polygenic genetic architecture fully consistent with robust biological systems supported by multiple back-up mechanisms is now overwhelming. In this context, we consider the recent ""omnigenic"" or ""core genes"" model. A key assumption of the model is that there is a relatively small number of core genes relevant to any disease. While intuitively appealing, this model may underestimate the biological complexity of common disease, and therefore, the goal to discover core genes should not guide experimental design. We consider other implications of polygenicity, concluding that a focus on patient stratification is needed to achieve the goals of precision medicine."	Cell	14/06/2018

In the present study, we aimed to examine the expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) related to BCBM in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues to identify their usefulness as predictive biomarkers of breast cancer brain recurrence (BCBR). METHODS: Pairs of primary breast and metastatic site tissue samples were collected from 38 patients who experienced the first recurrence of metastasis to a single distant organ (brain/lungs/liver/bones = 11/12/9/6 patients) between January 2007 and December 2021 at five institutions in Japan. We evaluated the expression of 15 miRNAs in FFPE specimens of untreated breast and metastatic sites from the same patient using quantitative polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Analysis of the selected 15 miRNAs revealed that hsa-miR-155-5p exhibited significant BCBR-specific overexpression in untreated primary breast tissues (p < 0.001). Two other miRNAs, hsa-miR-150-5p and hsa-miR-20b-5p, exhibited moderate (ρ = 0.587) and weak (ρ = 0.350) positive correlations with hsa-miR-155-5p, respectively. The BCBR prediction model demonstrated a high discrimination ability for hsa-miR-155-5p (AUC = 0.960). The localization of hsa-miR-155-5p in primary breast cancer tissue by in situ hybridization confirmed that hsa-miR-155-5p was uniformly stained in the breast cancer cells. CONCLUSIONS: Hsa-miR-155-5p expression in untreated primary breast tissue may be a valuable biomarker for predicting BCBR. A personalized escalation strategy is expected to be helpful in conquering brain metastases.	Breast cancer research : BCR	29/09/2025

The main aim of this study was to analyze the relation between resilience, personality traits, and hopelessness. Furthermore, we conducted comparisons between two age groups: young and older adults. The sample comprised 439 Spanish participants (66.7% women; M = 43.73, SD = 26.41; age range = 18-98 years). The Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale, NEO-Five Factor Inventory, and Beck Hopelessness Scale were used to measure the main study variables. The results revealed a negative relation between resilience and neuroticism, and a positive association with the other personality traits. Additionally, levels of resilience were found to be negatively related to hopelessness. The group of older adults showed significantly lower resilience levels than the young adults, although age was not a significant predictor of resilience. Neuroticism, extraversion, openness, and hopelessness were the only predictors of resilience for the current study. This work contributes to the study of resilience and related factors, by attempting to understand the role of resilience and resistance to risk and how individuals tackle challenges over time, with important implications for mental health.

10.1186/s40364-025-00831-w	1-year risks of cancers associated with COVID-19 vaccination: a large	Kim HJ, Kim MH, Choi MG, Chun EM	The oncogenic potential of SARS-CoV-2 has been hypothetically proposed, but real-world data on COVID-19 infection and vaccination are insufficient. Therefore, this large-scale population-based retrospective study in Seoul, South Korea, aimed to estimate the cumulative incidences and subsequent risks of overall cancers 1 year after COVID-19 vaccination. Data from 8,407,849 individuals between 2021 and 2023 were obtained from the Korean National Health Insurance database. The participants were categorized into two groups based on their COVID-19 vaccination status. The risks for overall cancer were assessed using multivariable Cox proportional hazards models, and data were expressed as hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The HRs of thyroid (HR, 1.351; 95% CI, 1.206-1.514), gastric (HR, 1.335; 95% CI, 1.130-1.576), colorectal (HR, 1.283; 95% CI, 1.122-1.468), lung (HR, 1.533; 95% CI, 1.254-1.874), breast (HR, 1.197; 95% CI, 1.069-1.340), and prostate (HR, 1.687; 95% CI, 1.348-2.111) cancers significantly increased at 1 year post-vaccination. In terms of vaccine type, cDNA vaccines were associated with the increased risks of thyroid, gastric, colorectal, lung, and prostate cancers; mRNA vaccines were linked to the increased risks of thyroid, colorectal, lung, and breast cancers; and heterologous vaccination was related to the increased risks of thyroid and breast cancers. Given the observed associations between COVID-19 vaccination and cancer incidence by age, sex, and vaccine type, further research is needed to determine whether specific vaccination strategies may be optimal for populations in need of COVID-19 vaccination.

Its effects in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension within the first year after diagnosis are unclear. METHODS: In this phase 3 trial, we enrolled adult patients with World Health Organization functional class II or III pulmonary arterial hypertension who had received the diagnosis less than 1 year earlier, had an intermediate or high risk of death, and were receiving double or triple background therapy. Patients were randomly assigned to receive add-on therapy with subcutaneous sotatercept (starting dose, 0.3 mg per kilogram of body weight; escalated to target dose, 0.7 mg per kilogram) or placebo every 21 days. The primary end point was clinical worsening, a composite of death from any cause, unplanned hospitalization lasting at least 24 hours for worsening of pulmonary arterial hypertension, atrial septostomy, lung transplantation, or deterioration in performance in exercise testing due to pulmonary arterial hypertension, assessed in a time-to-first-event analysis. RESULTS: The trial was stopped early owing to loss of clinical equipoise after the reporting of positive results from previous sotatercept trials. A total of 320 patients were included (160 each in the sotatercept and placebo groups). The median duration of follow-up was 13.2 months. At least one primary end-point event occurred in 17 patients (10.6%) in the sotatercept group and in 59 patients (36.9%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.24; 95% confidence interval, 0.14 to 0.41; P<0.001). Deterioration in performance in exercise testing due to pulmonary arterial hypertension occurred in 8 patients (5.0%) in the sotatercept group and in 46 patients (28.8%) in the placebo group; unplanned hospitalization for worsening of pulmonary arterial hypertension occurred in 3 patients (1.9%) and 14 patients (8.8%), respectively; and death from any cause occurred in 7 patients (4.4%) and 6 patients (3.8%). No cases of atrial septostomy or lung transplantation occurred. The most common adverse events with sotatercept were epistaxis (31.9%) and telangiectasia (26.2%).

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the possible relationships among gut metagenomics, plasma metabolomics and attention. DESIGN: We conducted faecal shotgun metagenomics and targeted plasma tryptophan metabolomics across three independent cohorts (n=156, n=124, n=804) with functional validations in preclinical models, including three faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) experiments in mice and Drosophila melanogaster. RESULTS: Obesity was consistently associated with reduced attention. Metagenomics analyses identified Proteobacteria species and microbial functions related to tryptophan biosynthesis from anthranilic acid (AA) as negatively associated with attention in obesity. Plasma tryptophan metabolic profiling and machine learning revealed that 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid (3-HAA) was positively associated with attention, particularly in obesity, while AA showed a negative association. Bariatric surgery improved attention and enriched microbial species linked to attention. In mice, diet-induced obesity (DIO) and microbiota depletion reduced 3-HAA and 5-hydroxy-indole acetic acid (5-HIAA) concentrations in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), which were restored by FMT. Global metabolic profiling (>600 metabolites) of PFC from the FMT group identified 3-HAA and the tryptophan and tyrosine pathways among the most significant in mice receiving microbiota from high-attention donors. A second FMT experiment also revealed a consistent enrichment of the tryptophan and tyrosine metabolism at the transcriptional level in the PFC, with Haao (3-hydroxyantrhanilic acid dioxygenase) and Aox4 (aldehyde oxidase 4), key in 3-HAA and 5-HIAA degradation, among the significantly regulated genes. In a third FMT study, attentional traits were transmitted from humans to mice alongside modulation of serotonergic and dopaminergic pathways. In Drosophila, mono-colonisation with Enterobacter cloacae and DIO induced attention deficit-like behaviours, which were mitigated by 3-HAA supplementation. CONCLUSIONS: We have identified the microbiota and 3-HAA as potential therapeutic targets to improve attention, especially in obesity.	Gut	27/09/2025
10.1038/s41392-025-02409-2	Tumor microenvironment delineates differential responders to trastuzumab	Pan H, Wang J, Sun Y, Li F, Sun C, Liu M, Xu H, Tao J, Mao X, Wang C, Wang S, Li W, Ding Q, Zhou W	Trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) has been approved for the treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer. However, the efficacy of T-DM1 for patients after failure of pyrotinib and/or trastuzumab plus pertuzumab has not been clear. Additionally, no biomarker has been reported to predict the effect of T-DM1. In this multicenter phase II trial (NCT06125834), 36 participants with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer were enrolled to receive T-DM1 therapy on a 21-day cycle until progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary endpoint was the objective response rate (ORR). The secondary endpoints included the disease control rate (DCR), clinical benefit rate (CBR), progression-free survival (PFS), and toxicity. The primary endpoint was an ORR of 47.2% (17/36, 95% CI 30.4-64.5). The treatment exhibited a manageable toxicity profile. The DCR was 66.7% (24/36, 95% CI 49.0-81.4), and the CBR was 50.0% (18/36, 95% CI 32.9-67.1). The median PFS was 6.6 (95% CI 5.2-NA) months. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that the low cell cycle activity of cancer cells, activated macrophages and CD8+ T cells was associated with the good efficacy of T-DM1, which was validated in a neoadjuvant cohort. This study suggests that T-DM1 is effective with a measurable safety profile in patients with metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer after failure of pyrotinib and/or trastuzumab plus pertuzumab. Our preliminary findings suggest potential biomarkers that may help predict T-DM1 efficacy, generating hypotheses for novel therapeutic targets that may address T-DM1 resistance.

The safety and efficacy profiles of available RSV vaccines, a critical consideration for their integration into public health strategies and clinical practice, remain uncertain. OBJECTIVES: To assess the benefits and harms of RSV vaccines compared to placebo, no intervention, vaccines for other respiratory infections, other RSV vaccines, or monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) across all human populations. SEARCH METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive literature search of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the WHO ICTRP following standard systematic review methodology from 2000 to April 2024. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: We included both randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and non-randomised studies of interventions (NRSIs) involving all human populations comparing RSV vaccines with placebo, no intervention, vaccines for other respiratory infections, other RSV vaccines, or mAbs. We excluded studies focused on dose-finding schedules and immunogenicity assessment. OUTCOMES: Benefits included frequency of RSV illness (both lower and upper respiratory illness) confirmed by laboratory tests (RSV-associated lower respiratory tract illness and RSV-associated acute respiratory illness); hospitalisation due to RSV disease (both lower and upper respiratory illness) confirmed by laboratory tests; mortality from illness caused by RSV (confirmed by laboratory test); all-cause mortality; and admission to an intensive care unit. Harms included serious adverse events (SAEs) related to vaccination, including neurological disorders such as Guillain-Barré syndrome. RISK OF BIAS: We assessed risk of bias in RCTs using Cochrane's RoB 2 tool. SYNTHESIS METHODS: We used standard Cochrane methods. INCLUDED STUDIES: We identified 14 RCTs: five trials (101,825 participants) on older adults; three trials (12,010 participants) on maternal vaccination and effects on infants; one trial (300 participants) on women of childbearing age; and five trials (192 participants) on infants and children. We identified no NRSIs. SYNTHESIS OF RESULTS: RSV prefusion vaccine versus placebo in older adults These vaccines reduced RSV-associated lower respiratory tract illness with vaccine efficacy (VE) of 77% (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.70 to 0.83; risk ratio (RR) 0.23, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.30; 4 RCTs, 99,931 participants; high-certainty evidence) and	The Cochrane database of systematic reviews	29/09/2025

We sought to investigate the oncogenic role of poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase (PARG) and test potential therapeutic strategies. METHODS: A tissue microarray comprising 275 CCA patient samples was analyzed by immunohistochemistry. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry was utilized to identify downstream targets of PARG. Transgenic mice (Parg(f/f)) were employed to establish spontaneous CCA model via hydrodynamic tail vein injection (HTVi) and biliary instillation (BI). The efficacy of PARG inhibition was tested in various CCA preclinical models, including patient derived organoids (PDOs), patient-derived xenograft (PDX), an immunocompetent syngeneic murine model, and orthotopic xenograft models. Cytometry by time of flight (CyTOF) analysis was utilized to profile the changes in tumor microenvironment following PARG inhibition and anti-PD-1 therapy. RESULTS: PARG is highly expressed in CCA and predicts a dismal prognosis based on analysis of a large patient cohort. Genetic depletion of Parg in spontaneous CCA models induced by two methods, including HTVi and BI, significantly halted carcinogenesis. PARG inhibition alone showed impressive efficacy and potentiated Gem/Cis in PDOs, PDX, and orthotopic models. Mechanistically, PARG dePARylates and suppresses ITCH autoubiquitination, thus inhibiting the Hippo pathway, which promotes CCA proliferation and chemoresistance. Moreover, CyTOF analysis revealed the crosstalk between the tumor and stroma, which could be suppressed by PARG inhibitors via TEADs/CXCR4/CXCL12 axis. Combining PD-1 blockade and Gem/Cis with PARG inhibitors resulted in a significantly greater reduction in tumor burden, as well as a survival benefit. CONCLUSIONS: Targeting PARG limits CCA progression, alleviates desmoplasia, and enhances response to both anti-PD-1 therapy and chemotherapy. LAY SUMMARY: Little is known about the role of PARG in CCA development and progression. Herein, we show that PARG expression is upregulated and hyperactivated in CCA, promoting tumor cell proliferation, cancer-associated fibroblast recruitment, and resistance to therapy. Pharmacological inhibition of PARG suppresses CCA development and could be an effective therapeutic strategy when combined with chemotherapy and immunotherapy.	Journal of hepatology	26/09/2025
10.1038/s41418-025-01590-9	AMPK-activated BAP1 regulates pVHL stability and tumor-suppressive functions.	Li M, Huang L, Chen J, Guan T, Wen Y, Zhu Y, Yang X, Zhang C, Ma X, Wan R, He Y, Zhou Y, Song Y, Zhang H, Liu T	The von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) protein (pVHL) functions as a potent tumor suppressor by mediating the degradation or inactivation of various substrates, including HIFα and Akt. However, pVHL is frequently downregulated in numerous cancers harboring wild-type VHL, and underlying mechanisms remains elusive. Aberrant glucose metabolism is a hallmark of cancer, driving tumor progression and therapeutic resistance. Despite this, the connection between glucose homoeostasis and pVHL turnover and functions has yet to be defined. In this study, we demonstrate that dysregulated glucose metabolism destabilizes pVHL in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), colorectal, and ovarian cancer cells. Mechanistically, energy stress induced by glucose starvation, 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG), or metformin activates AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which subsequently phosphorylates and activates BAP1, a deubiquitinase whose specific function in targeting pVHL for deubiquitination and stabilization had not been previously characterized. Specifically, AMPKα phosphorylates BAP1 at residues S123, S469, and S583, enhancing the interaction between BAP1 and pVHL and promoting pVHL stabilization and tumor-suppressive function both in vitro and in vivo. Conversely, disrupting BAP1 phosphorylation through AMPKα depletion or reconstitution with a phosphorylation-defective BAP1 mutant (S123A/S469A/S583A) abolishes the BAP1-pVHL interaction, leading to impaired pVHL stabilization and accelerated tumor progression in cancer cell lines and patient-derived xenograft models. Clinically, our analysis reveals a positive correlation between levels of phosphorylated AMPKα (p-AMPKα), phosphorylated Ser123-BAP1 (pSer123-BAP1), and pVHL levels in PDAC, colorectal cancer, and ovarian cancer specimens. Collectively, these findings elucidate a novel mechanism linking dysregulated glucose metabolism to compromised function of the BAP1-pVHL tumor-suppressive axis. Our results suggest that therapeutic strategies designed to activate this pathway may represent a promising approach for treating cancers characterized by downregulated wild-type VHL and aberrant glucose metabolism.

High-affinity antibodies required to maximize killing detect low antigen expression in normal tissue, risking ""on-target, off-cancer"" toxicity. This compels identification of cancer-restricted cell-surface protein antigens, which are rare. Tumor-associated carbohydrate antigens (TACAs) are the most abundant and widespread cancer antigens known but are poorly targetable by antibodies. Here, we describe glycan-dependent T cell recruiter (GlyTR) pan-cancer immunotherapeutics that utilize high-avidity ""velcro-like"" lectin binding to kill cells with high but not low TACA expression. GlyTR1 and GlyTR2 bind immunosuppressive β1,6GlcNAc-branched N-glycans or multiple TACAs (Tn, sialyl-Tn, LacDiNAc, and GD2), respectively, overcome immunosuppressive mechanisms in the tumor microenvironment and trigger target-density-dependent T cell-mediated pan-cancer killing, yet they lack toxicity in mice with human-like TACA expression. Density-dependent lectin binding to TACAs provides highly potent and safe pan-cancer immunotherapeutics."	Cell	25/09/2025
10.1016/j.jare.2025.09.039	Global, regional, and national burden of cardiovascular diseases among	Xu S, Jia S, Yang S, Li D, Zhang E, Lei F, Zeng ML, Lin L	BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) remain the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. In postmenopausal women, physiological changes and hormonal transitions accelerate cardiovascular risk, yet global, sex-specific evidence for this group remains limited. Understanding their burden is essential to address biological vulnerabilities and structural inequities. AIM OF REVIEW: This review provides the first comprehensive global, regional, and national assessment of CVD burden among women aged ≥ 55 years from 1990 to 2021 and projects trends to 2040. It synthesizes epidemiological patterns, socio-demographic disparities, and major modifiable risk factors, with the goal of informing gender-sensitive and equity-oriented cardiovascular prevention and policy strategies. KEY SCIENTIFIC CONCEPTS OF REVIEW: Data were obtained from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Study 2021, encompassing 204 countries and territories. Incidence, prevalence, mortality, and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) were analyzed using age-standardized rates (ASRs). Temporal trends were quantified with estimated annual percentage changes (EAPCs), and decomposition analysis identified demographic (population growth, aging) and epidemiological contributions. Inequalities were evaluated using slope and concentration indices across socio-demographic index (SDI) levels. Bayesian age-period-cohort models were applied to forecast CVD burden through 2040. Key findings indicate that although ASIR and ASMR declined globally, absolute CVD cases and deaths nearly doubled due to demographic expansion. Disparities widened: high-SDI regions achieved the steepest reductions, while low-SDI regions showed slower progress or worsening trends. Ischemic heart disease and stroke remained the dominant contributors, endocarditis was the fastest-rising subtype, and high systolic blood pressure consistently emerged as the leading modifiable risk factor. Collectively, these findings highlight a growing and uneven burden of CVD in postmenopausal women. Strengthened hypertension control, integrated prevention strategies, and investment in primary healthcare-particularly in low-SDI settings-are urgently needed. This review provides a woman-centered evidence base to support equitable cardiovascular health policy and resource allocation.	Journal of advanced research	24/09/2025
10.1186/1471-2407-8-221	Esophageal cancer risk by type of alcohol drinking and smoking: a case-control	Vioque J, Barber X, Bolumar F, Porta M, Santibáñez M, de la Hera MG, Moreno-Osset E	BACKGROUND: The effect of tobacco smoking and alcohol drinking on esophageal cancer (EC) has never been explored in Spain where black tobacco and wine consumptions are quite prevalent. We estimated the independent effect of different alcoholic beverages and type of tobacco smoking on the risk of EC and its main histological cell type (squamous cell carcinoma) in a hospital-based case-control study in a Mediterranean area of Spain. METHODS: We only included incident cases with histologically confirmed EC (n = 202). Controls were frequency-matched to cases by age, sex and province (n = 455). Information on risk factors was elicited by trained interviewers using structured questionnaires. Multiple logistic regression was used to estimate adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CI). RESULTS: Alcohol drinking and tobacco smoking were strong and independent risk factors for esophageal cancer. Alcohol was a potent risk factor with a clear dose-response relationship, particularly for esophageal squamous-cell cancer. Compared to never-drinkers, the risk for heaviest drinkers (> or = 75 g/day of pure ethanol) was 7.65 (95%CI, 3.16-18.49); and compared with never-smokers, the risk for heaviest smokers (> or = 30 cigarettes/day) was 5.07 (95%CI, 2.06-12.47). A low consumption of only wine and/or beer (1-24 g/d) did not increase the risk whereas a strong positive trend was observed for all types of alcoholic beverages that included any combination of hard liquors with beer and/or wine (p-trend<0.00001). A significant increase in EC risk was only observed for black-tobacco smoking (2.5-fold increase), not for blond tobacco. The effects for alcohol drinking were much stronger when the analysis was limited to the esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (n = 160), whereas a lack of effect for adenocarcinoma was evidenced. Smoking cessation showed a beneficial effect within ten years whereas drinking cessation did not. CONCLUSION: Our study shows that the risk of EC, and particularly the squamous cell type, is strongly associated with alcohol drinking. The consumption of any combination of hard liquors seems to be harmful whereas a low consumption of only wine may not. This may relates to the presence of certain antioxidant compounds found in wine but practically lacking in liquors. Tobacco smoking is also a clear risk factor, black more than blond.

10.1016/j.jare.2025.09.038	Analyzing and forecasting global cervical cancer burden based on WHO's	Huang Y, Lin W, Chen X, Zheng X, Yi H, Zhang L	INTRODUCTION: Cervical cancer remains a major global public health challenge. In 2018, the WHO launched a strategy to eliminate cervical cancer, emphasizing the need for precise epidemiological assessments. OBJECTIVES: This study utilized Global Burden of Disease (GBD) data to analyze the epidemiological indicators, geographical patterns, and temporal trends of cervical cancer, evaluating the global impact of the WHO's strategy. METHODS: Data on cervical cancer from 204 countries and territories (from 1990 to 2021) were retrieved from the GBD database. The year 2018, marking the WHO's global call for elimination, was used to divide data into two periods: 1990 to 2018 and 2019 to 2021. Trends in age-standardized incidence rates and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) were assessed using estimated annual percentage changes (EAPCs) and joinpoint regression. The socio-demographic index (SDI) was regressed against epidemiological indicators to explore disparities. Health inequality analyses recommended by the WHO were conducted, and an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model was applied to predict future trends. RESULTS: From 1990 to 2021, global age-standardized incidence rates and DALYs declined. During 1990 to 2018, the highest EAPC values were observed in Southern Sub-Saharan Africa (2·18), East Asia (0·69), and Eastern Europe (0·31). After 2019, a more significant improvement was noted globally. Regression analyses revealed an	Journal of advanced research	25/09/2025
10.1111/irv.12474	The efficacy of medical masks and respirators against respiratory infection in	MacIntyre CR, Chughtai AA, Rahman B, Peng Y, Zhang Y, Seale H, Wang X, Wang Q	"OBJECTIVE: We aimed to examine the efficacy of medical masks and respirators in protecting against respiratory infections using pooled data from two homogenous randomised control clinical trials (RCTs). METHODS: The data collected on 3591 subjects in two similar RCTs conducted in Beijing, China, which examined the same infection outcomes, were pooled. Four interventions were compared: (i) continuous N95 respirator use, (ii) targeted N95 respirator use, (iii) medical mask use and (iv) control arm. The outcomes were laboratory-confirmed viral respiratory infection, influenza A or B, laboratory-confirmed bacterial colonisation and pathogens grouped by mode of transmission. RESULTS: Rates of all outcomes were consistently lower in the continuous N95 and/or targeted N95 arms. In adjusted analysis, rates of laboratory-confirmed bacterial colonisation (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.21-0.51), laboratory-confirmed viral infections (RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.23-0.91) and droplet-transmitted infections (RR 0.26, 95% CI 0.16-0.42) were significantly lower in the continuous N95 arm. Laboratory-confirmed influenza was also lowest in the continuous N95 arm (RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.10-1.11), but the difference was not statistically significant. Rates of laboratory-confirmed bacterial colonisation (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.33-0.87) and droplet-transmitted infections (RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.25-0.72) were also lower in the targeted N95 arm, but not in medical mask arm. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that the classification of infections into droplet versus airborne transmission is an oversimplification. Most guidelines recommend masks for infections spread by droplets. N95 respirators, as ""airborne precautions,"" provide superior protection for droplet-transmitted infections. To ensure the occupational health and safety of healthcare worker, the superiority of respirators in preventing respiratory infections should be reflected in infection control guidelines."

10.1016/j.mam.2025.101413	The double-edged sword: How SARS-CoV-2 might fuel lung cancer: Investigating the	Shen W, Guo Y, Ai C, Wang X, Li G	The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by SARS-CoV-2, has had far-reaching consequences beyond acute respiratory illness, with growing evidence suggesting potential long-term oncogenic effects. Lung cancer, a leading cause of cancer-related mortality, may intersect with COVID-19 through shared molecular pathways and altered disease dynamics. SARS-CoV-2 can exacerbate outcomes in existing cancer patients and potentially contribute to de novo lung carcinogenesis or accelerate progression via chronic inflammation, oxidative stress, immune dysregulation, cellular senescence, cell cycle disruption, metabolic reprogramming, and autophagy impairment. It has been proven that although the SARS virus is not capable of integrating into the host genome, it uses the mechanisms of other human oncoviruses to cause lung cancer. Post-COVID-19 pulmonary fibrosis, observed in up to one-third of severe cases, may act as a tumor precursor bridge through sustained tissue remodeling, extracellular matrix stiffness, and hypoxia-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Epidemiological studies indicate increased cancer-related mortality, metastatic reactivation of dormant cancer cells, and diagnostic delays, shifting presentations toward advanced stages during the pandemic. Synergistic risk factors, including smoking, air pollution, occupational exposures, and genetic predispositions, may further amplify oncogenic potential. The convergence of viral, environmental, and host factors creates a critical need for vigilant surveillance, biomarker development, and preventive strategies. This study aims to synthesize current epidemiological evidence, elucidate the molecular and cellular mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 may influence lung carcinogenesis, and highlight clinical implications to guide future research, screening, and therapeutic interventions.

10.1186/s13045-025-01739-6	Combination immunotherapy in hepatocellular carcinoma: synergies among immune	Dai S, Chen Y, Cai W, Dong S, Zhao J, Chen L, Cheng CS	Combination therapy is rapidly becoming the cornerstone of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treatment. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have emerged as a central strategy in systemic therapy, yet their efficacy as monotherapies remains limited. Consequently, combinatorial approaches, such as ICIs-Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), ICIs-chemotherapy, and dual ICI regimens, are gaining momentum. While clinical trials have established efficacy benchmarks, mechanistic insights remain scarce, partly due to the limitations of current preclinical models in mimicking the complex tumor microenvironment (TME). Given the substantial heterogeneity of HCC, spanning genetic, transcriptomic, and immunologic dimensions, treatment outcomes vary widely. Additional factors such as gut microbiota and epigenetic modifications further influence therapeutic response and resistance. Although PD-1, PD-L1, and CTLA-4 inhibitors are widely used, unresponsiveness is common. Novel targets such as LAG-3, TIM-3, TIGIT, and VISTA, as well as strategies to reprogram fibrotic and immunosuppressive TME, are under active investigation. Ultimately, translating basic insights into personalized therapy will depend on predictive biomarkers and integrated analyses that account for the complex interactions among tumor cells, the immune system, and the TME. This review synthesizes current knowledge and cellular mechanisms underpinning combination therapies, highlights therapeutic synergies, and discusses emerging directions for stratified treatment in HCC.

10.1159/000480657	Geniposide Attenuates Post-Ischaemic Neurovascular Damage via GluN2A/AKT/	Huang B, Chen P, Huang L, Li S, Zhu R, Sheng T, Yu W, Chen Z, Wang T	BACKGROUND/AIMS: Calcium-permeable ionotropic NMDAR-mediated hyperactivity is regarded as the critical factor in modulating the development of ischaemic stroke. Recently, there has been increasing interest in preventing post-stroke neuronal death by focusing on intervening in the function of subpopulations of NMDARs and their downstream signalling. Geniposide, an iridoid glycoside, has been found to have cytoprotective functions in various conditions. However, it is still unclear whether and how geniposide affects neuronal insult under experimental stroke. METHODS: We demonstrate that dose-dependent geniposide significantly decreased the infarct volume in tMCAO models. RESULTS: A medium level of geniposide improved anti-apoptotic functions and inhibited BBB leakage/haemorrhage via elevating GluN2A-containing NMDAR expression in tMCAO rats. Importantly, these effects could be eliminated by co-treatment of geniposide with the GluN2A antagonist NVP but not the GluN2B inhibitor ifenprodil. Moreover, geniposide's protection was due to the enhancement of GluN2A-dependent survival signals, including pAKT, pERK and PSD-95. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that geniposide protects neurons against post-ischaemic neurovascular injury through the activation of GluN2A/AKT/ERK pathways. As a very promising natural agent, geniposide may be a future therapeutic for stroke patients.	Cellular physiology and biochemistry : international journal of experimental	01/01/2017
10.1038/s41586-025-09574-y	SPP1 is required for maintaining mesenchymal cell fate in pancreatic cancer.	Li H, Lan L, Chen H, Zaw Thin M, Ps H, Nelson JK, Evans IM, Ruiz EJ, Cheng R, Tran L, Allen M, Ma J, Yi T, Wang C, He Y, Guppy N, Sadanandam A, Lin SZ, Zhang C, Behrens A	Elucidating the complex network of communication between tumour cells is central to understanding cell fate decisions and progression of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC)(1,2). We previously showed that constant suppression of BMP activity by the BMP antagonist GREM1 secreted by mesenchymal PDAC cells is essential for maintaining the fate of epithelial PDAC cells(3). Here we identify SPP1 (also known as osteopontin)(4) as a key regulator of mesenchymal cell fate in pancreatic cancer. Proteomic analysis of plasma from patients with PDAC showed that SPP1 is substantially upregulated in late-stage disease. Inactivation of Spp1 led to a delay in tumorigenesis in mouse PDAC models and abolished metastasis formation. Spp1 was expressed in epithelial PDAC cells, and Spp1 inactivation resulted in a conversion of mesenchymal to epithelial PDAC cells. Mechanistically, SPP1 bound the CD61 receptor on mesenchymal PDAC cells to induce Bmp2 and Grem1 expression, and GREM1 inhibition of BMP signalling was required for Spp1 expression in epithelial cells, thereby forming an intercellular regulatory loop. Concomitant inactivation of Grem1 reverted the epithelial phenotype of Spp1 knockout to fully mesenchymal PDAC. Conversely, Grem1 heterozygosity combined with Spp1 knockout resulted in wild-type PDAC histology, a result that confirmed the direct antagonistic functions of these factors. Hence, mesenchymal and epithelial PDAC cell fates are determined by the reciprocal paracrine regulation of the soluble factors GREM1 and SPP1.	Nature	24/09/2025

Upregulated intestinal proteolysis and PAR(2) signaling are implicated in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), conditions often associated with gut microbiome alterations. To identify potential bacterial regulators of PAR(2) activity, we developed a functional assay for PAR(2) processing to screen a library of diverse gut microbes. We identify multiple bacteria that secrete proteases capable of cleaving host PAR(2). Using chemoproteomic profiling with a covalent irreversible inhibitor, we uncovered a previously uncharacterized Bacteroides fragilis serine protease 1 (Bfp1) and show that it cleaves and activates PAR(2) in multicellular and murine models. PAR(2) cleavage by Bfp1 disrupts the intestinal barrier, sensitizes nociceptors, and triggers colonic inflammation and abdominal pain. Collectively, our findings uncover Bfp1-mediated PAR(2) processing as an axis of host-commensal interaction in the gut that has the potential to be targeted for therapeutic intervention in IBD or IBS.

Overall response rate (ORR) was the primary endpoint, and progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), time to treatment failure (TTF), time to next treatment (TTNT) and safety were the secondary endpoints. Between November 2020 and August 2023, 1,794 patients were screened, 897 were evaluated by the molecular tumor board (MTB) and 400 were randomized to TT or SoC. TT achieved a significantly higher ORR (17.5% versus 10%; P = 0.0294) and improved median PFS (3.5 months versus 2.8 months; hazard ratio = 0.66 (0.53-0.82), P = 0.0002). TT also showed superior 12-month PFS rates (22.0% versus 8.3%). Median OS was similar, with a 52% crossover rate. Grade 3/4 adverse events were also similar (40% TT versus 52% SoC). These results highlight the potential of TT to improve outcomes for patients with diverse actionable genomic alterations. These results also provide relevant evidence supporting a tumor-agnostic precision oncology strategy and highlight the potential of TTs, guided by genomic profiling and MTB recommendations, to significantly improve outcomes for patients with diverse actionable genomic alterations.

10.1016/S1474-4422(25)00249-2	Blood and CSF biomarkers for multiple sclerosis: emerging clinical applications.	Chitnis T, Magliozzi R, Abdelhak A, Kuhle J, Leppert D, Bielekova B	Neurofilament light chain (NfL), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), chitinase-3-like protein 1 (CHI3L1), and other protein assays are being developed as diagnostic or prognostic biomarkers in multiple sclerosis. An increase in NfL concentrations reflects axonal damage resulting from the acute new inflammatory disease activity that occurs during a relapse. NfL concentrations can also reflect the occurrence of new MRI lesions. GFAP concentrations are increased in people with progressive forms of multiple sclerosis, and GFAP is an emerging biomarker of progression independent of relapses. CHI3L1 is an emerging biomarker associated with progression independent of relapse activity and several MRI lesion types, including paramagnetic rim lesions. Some biomarkers, particularly NfL, can help monitoring treatment response, and combinations of multivariate biomarkers provide additional accuracy in specific clinical scenarios. In multiple sclerosis, fluid-based biomarkers are quickly emerging as instruments for clinical monitoring of disease course and patients' response to treatment.	The Lancet. Neurology	24/09/2025
10.1152/advan.00039.2021	Effect of self-regulated learning and technology-enhanced activities on anatomy	Bains M, Kaliski DZ, Goei KA	Problem-based learning (PBL) offers advantages for teaching anatomy and physiology for physical therapy students as clinical cases provide a scaffold for a comprehensive review of body systems. Although the utilization of interactive anatomy software greatly contributes to an active learning environment and efficient use of time, simply providing textbook readings, access to anatomy software, and models is not enough to engage students to become active in reaching their learning goals. Time constraints, meaningful technology implementation, resource abundance, and unfamiliarity are challenges that decrease the effectiveness of both facilitating and learning anatomy. The present study investigated the use of three supplemental learning tools to support anatomy instruction in a self-regulated manner. Friedman test results demonstrated significant differences for perceived engagement [χ(2)(2) = 15.74, P < 0.001, W = 0.23] but not for perceived learning. Survey responses demonstrated that perceived engagement was greatest with the nondigital supplemental learning tool compared with the two technology-enhanced learning tools (iBooks Author + SoftChalk and SoftChalk alone). Multivariate regression analyses demonstrated statistically significant relationships between the nondigital supplemental learning tool and anatomy practical scores (P < 0.001). The technology-enhanced supplemental learning tools did not further increase learning outcomes as measured by practical scores compared with nondigital learning tools. Incorporation of instructor-created instructional materials independent of technology is an efficient method to drive self-regulated learning, enhance engagement, and improve anatomy course outcomes and may overcome barriers associated with a purely self-directed PBL model.

10.1088/1361-6560/aca3f8	Experimental feasibility of xenon-enhanced dual-energy radiography for imaging of	Basharat F, Tanguay J	Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a leading cause of death worldwide. We experimentally investigated the feasibility of two-dimensional xenon-enhanced dual-energy (XeDE) radiography for imaging of lung function. We optimized image quality under quantum-noise-limited conditions using a chest phantom consisting of a rectangular chamber representing the thoracic volume and PMMA slabs simulating x-ray attenuation by soft tissue. A sealed, air-filled cavity with thin PMMA walls was positioned inside the chamber to simulate a 2 cm thick ventilation defect. The chamber was ventilated with xenon and dual-energy imaging was performed using a diagnostic x-ray tube and a flat-panel detector. The contrast-to-noise ratio of ventilation defects normalized by patient x-ray exposure maximized at a kV-pair of approximately 60/140-kV and when approximately one third of the total exposure was allocated to the HE image. We used the optimized technique to image a second phantom that contained lung-parenchyma-mimicking PMMA clutter, rib-mimicking aluminum slats and an insert that simulated ventilation defects with thicknesses ranging from 0.5 cm to 2 cm and diameters ranging from 1 cm to 2 cm. From the resulting images we computed the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of the non-prewhitening model observer with an eye filter and internal noise. For a xenon concentration of 75%, good AUCs (i.e. 0.8-0.9) to excellent AUCs (i.e. >0.9) were obtained when the defect diameter is greater than 1.3 cm and defect thickness is 1 cm. When the xenon concentration was reduced to 50%, the AUC was ∼0.9 for defects 1.2 cm in diameter and ∼1.5 cm in thickness. Two-dimensional XeDE radiography may therefore enable detection of functional abnormalities associated with early-stage COPD, for which xenon ventilation defects can occupy up to 20% of the lung volume, and should be further developed as a low-cost alternative to MRI-based approaches and a low-dose alternative to CT-based approaches.

10.1016/j.ccell.2025.09.001	Single-cell resolution spatial analysis of antigen-presenting cancer-associated	Chen X, Zhou Z, Xie L, Qiao K, Jia Y, Liu S, Yazgan Z, Rossi F, Liu Y, Zhang B, Polanco PM, Zeh HJ 3rd, Kim AC, Huang H	Recent studies identify a unique subtype of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) termed antigen-presenting CAFs (apCAFs), which remain poorly understood. To gain a comprehensive understanding of the origin and function of apCAFs, we construct a fibroblast molecular atlas across 15 types of tissues and solid tumors. Our integration study unexpectedly reveals two distinct apCAF populations present in most cancer types: one associated with mesothelial-like cells and the other with fibrocytes. Using a high-resolution single-cell spatial imaging platform, we characterize the spatial niches of these apCAF populations. We find that mesothelial-like apCAFs are located near cancer cells, while fibrocyte-like apCAFs are associated with lymphocyte-enriched niches. Additionally, we discovered that both apCAF populations can up-regulate secreted phosphoprotein 1 (SPP1), which facilitates primary tumor formation, peritoneal metastasis, and therapy resistance. Taken together, this study offers an unprecedented resolution in analyzing apCAFs and their spatial niches.	Cancer cell	25/09/2025

However, the genetic determinants of human oocyte/embryo defects remain largely unknown, and the overall genetic diagnostic yield for such defects has not been evaluated. Here, we performed exome sequencing in 3,627 patients with oocyte/embryo defects. We identified a total of 479 positive cases carrying variants in 37 known genes, indicating a diagnostic yield of 13.2%. Case-control association studies combined with gene set enrichment analysis identified 123 novel candidate genes responsible for oocyte/embryo defects. These results provide a comprehensive genetic landscape of human oocyte/embryo defects and highlight the clinical significance of genetic counseling in infertile patients with oocyte/embryo defects. Our study will lay the foundation for transforming the traditional clinical practice for failed IVF/ICSI attempts into genetic-based precision and personalized treatment for these patients.

Here we show that CA-enriched DNA fragments resulting from DNA-damaging chemotherapy in MSH2-low tumors preferentially bind cGAS with strong affinity and form biomolecular condensates by phase separation in the cytoplasm, resulting in antitumor immunity. However, classical CA-poor DNAs released from MSH2-high tumor cells engage AIM2, resulting in immunosuppression by upregulating PD-L1 and IDO. Intratumoral administration of CA-rich DNA fragments enhanced antitumor immunity in syngrafted PyMT tumors. Clinically, CA-rich DNA abundance in breast cancer following chemotherapy was associated with increased tumor-antigen-reactive T cells and better chemotherapeutic responses. Therefore, different tumor DNA fragments can trigger opposing immune responses depending on their preference for differential sensors. This study highlights another mechanistic link between genome instability and immune modulation and the therapeutic potential of CA-rich DNAs to enhance antitumor immunity.

10.7326/ANNALS-24-01863	Association Between Body Composition and Cardiometabolic Outcomes : A Prospective	Jung M, Reisert M, Rieder H, Rospleszcz S, Lu MT, Bamberg F, Raghu VK, Weiss J	BACKGROUND: Current measures of adiposity have limitations. Artificial intelligence (AI) models may accurately and efficiently estimate body composition (BC) from routine imaging. OBJECTIVE: To assess the association of AI-derived BC compartments from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with cardiometabolic outcomes. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: UK Biobank (UKB) observational cohort study. PARTICIPANTS: 33 432 UKB participants with no history of diabetes, myocardial infarction, or ischemic stroke (mean age, 65.0 years [SD, 7.8]; mean body mass index [BMI], 25.8 kg/m(2) [SD, 4.2]; 52.8% female) who underwent whole-body MRI. MEASUREMENTS: An AI tool was applied to MRI to derive 3-dimensional (3D) BC measures, including subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT), visceral adipose tissue (VAT), skeletal muscle (SM), and SM fat fraction (SMFF), and then calculate their relative distribution. Sex-stratified associations of these relative compartments with incident diabetes mellitus (DM) and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) were assessed using restricted cubic splines. RESULTS: Adipose tissue compartments and SMFF increased and SM decreased with age. After adjustment for age, smoking, and hypertension, greater adiposity and lower SM proportion were associated with higher incidence of DM and MACE after a median follow-up of 4.2 years in sex-stratified analyses; however, after additional adjustment for BMI and waist circumference (WC), only elevated VAT proportions and high SMFF (top fifth percentile in the cohort for each) were associated with increased risk for DM (respective adjusted hazard ratios [aHRs], 2.16 [95% CI, 1.59 to 2.94] and 1.27 [CI, 0.89 to 1.80] in females and 1.84 [CI, 1.48 to 2.27] and 1.84 [CI, 1.43 to 2.37] in males) and MACE (1.37 [CI, 1.00 to 1.88] and 1.72 [CI, 1.23 to 2.41] in females and 1.22 [CI, 0.99 to 1.50] and 1.25 [CI, 0.98 to 1.60] in males). In addition, in males only, those in the bottom fifth percentile of SM proportion had increased risk for DM (aHR for the bottom fifth percentile of the cohort, 1.96 [CI, 1.45 to 2.65]) and MACE (aHR, 1.55 [CI, 1.15 to 2.09]). LIMITATION: Results may not be generalizable to non-Whites or people outside the United Kingdom. CONCLUSION: Artificial intelligence-derived BC proportions were strongly associated with cardiometabolic risk, but after BMI and WC were accounted for, only VAT proportion and SMFF (both sexes) and SM proportion (males only) added prognostic information.

However, there is a paucity of high-quality toxicity data, leading to an absence of evidence-based guidelines. DESIGN: To address this, ESMO and ESTRO initiated a series of systematic reviews followed by a Delphi consensus process to develop multidisciplinary, evidence-based consensus statements regarding the safety of combining RT with such agents. The current publication describes the combination of RT with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), vascular endothelial growth factor (receptor) (VEGF(R)) inhibitors, or multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). By systematically covering different drug classes and irradiated areas, 76 clinical scenarios were evaluated during two Delphi rounds with 20 international experts. Safety statements were developed for each scenario, based on the systematic literature reviews. RESULTS: A total of 5,921 records were screened during the systematic literature review process for ICIs, VEGF(R) inhibitors and multitargeted TKIs, and 159 reports were selected for inclusion in the final literature reviews and the database. During the two Delphi rounds, agreement was reached regarding the safety statements for 74 clinical scenarios. CONCLUSIONS: Generally, the expected toxicity of combining RT with ICIs is low, particularly for PD-(L)1 inhibitors. For most combinations with VEGF(R) inhibitors and multitargeted TKIs, exercising caution is recommended. The evidence-based safety statements developed during this comprehensive project, provide practical guidance on combining RT with targeted cancer therapies and immunotherapy.

10.1016/j.beem.2025.102038	Preconception use of GLP-1 and GLP-1/GIP receptor agonists for obesity treatment.	Koceva A, Janež A, Jensterle M	Obesity is rising among women of reproductive age and significantly contributes to subfertility. If conception occurs, maternal obesity is associated with increased risks for both maternal and neonatal complications, with potential long-term effects on the offspring's health. Current clinical guidelines emphasize the importance of preconception weight optimization in women with obesity to reduce maternal and fetal risks. Amid the rising use of incretin-based anti-obesity medications, particularly among young women, their potential role in preconception care is receiving growing clinical and research interest. With unplanned pregnancies remaining common, incidental exposure during early pregnancy is becoming more likely. In parallel, there is increasing interest in the potential of these agents to support preconception weight loss and enhance fertility outcomes in women with obesity. This narrative review examines the current human evidence on GLP-1 and dual GLP-1/GIP receptor agonists approved for obesity treatment, focusing on their potential role in preconception care and addressing key safety considerations and challenges related to their use during the preconception period, as well as inadvertent exposure in early pregnancy.

The gut microbiota and their metabolites are closely associated with kidney injury. However, the exact mechanisms underlying this link are unclear. Here, we find that renal IRI reduces ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), a metabolite of Eubacterium limosum (E. limosum), in mice cecal content and serum. Conversely, supplementation with either E. limosum or UDCA prevents these mice from IRI. Mechanistically, UDCA directly binds and activates peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARγ) to increase fatty acid oxidation, inducing ATP production and reducing lipid accumulation in proximal tubular epithelial cells, ultimately protecting the kidney against IRI. Importantly, while renal IRI in patients markedly lowers their serum UDCA, patients with higher pre-IRI UDCA or E. limosum level develop less severe IRI. Collectively, our findings highlight the rationale of using UDCA and E. limosum for the prevention or treatment of renal IRI.	Cell reports. Medicine	26/09/2025

PURPOSE: To identify the pharmacological target and elucidate the mechanism of ATL III in CIRI protection. METHODS: Middle cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion (MCAO/R) in mice and oxygen-glucose deprivation/reperfusion (OGD/R) in HT22 cells were employed to evaluate the protective effects of ATL III on neurological function, oxidative stress, and apoptosis. Network pharmacology, molecular docking, surface plasmon resonance, and molecular dynamics were used to identify its direct target. Molecular mechanisms were validated using Western blot, immunofluorescence, and a pharmacological inhibitor both in vitro and in vivo. RESULTS: ATL III (10, 20, 40 mg/kg) significantly reduced infarct volume in MCAO/R mice from 42 % to 33 %, 27 %, and 20 %, and decreased neurological scores from 13 to 9, 7, and 5. Histology revealed alleviated hippocampal neuronal damage. In HT22 cells, ATL III decreased OGD/R-induced apoptosis, lowered ROS levels from 374 % to 202 %, increased SOD and GSH, and reduced MDA levels. Keap1 was identified as a direct target; ATL III disrupted the Keap1-Nrf2 interaction, reduced Keap1 protein levels, increased Nrf2 expression and nuclear translocation, and upregulated HO-1 expression. Nrf2 inhibition with ML385 abolished these antioxidative and neuroprotective effects in both models. CONCLUSION: ATL III protects against CIRI by directly targeting Keap1 and activating the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway. Given its favorable safety profile and blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability, ATL III holds promising translational potential as a plant-derived prophylactic agent for ischemic stroke.

10.1038/s41467-025-63343-z	Circular RNA-based protein replacement therapy mitigates osteoarthritis in male	Suo J, Li L, Tan W, Yin X, Wang J, Shao R, Sun S, Guo SK, Feng J, Gao BQ, Wang Y, Wei MY, Wang L, Feng H, Gao X, Hu P, Zheng X, Chen LL, Lei G, Huang Y, Zou W	In vitro-transcribed and circularized RNAs (ivcRNAs) represent a robust platform for sustained protein translation, offering promising potential for localized therapeutic delivery in joint diseases. Osteoarthritis (OA), the most prevalent degenerative joint disorder, remains a major clinical challenge due to its progressive nature and the lack of disease-modifying treatments. In this study, we identify Musashi2 (Msi2) deficiency in articular chondrocytes as a key contributor to OA pathogenesis. To evaluate the efficacy of ivcRNA-mediated protein replacement therapy, we developed a localized delivery strategy that enables high-yield and prolonged protein expression in chondrocytes. Using a destabilization of the medial meniscus (DMM) mouse model, we demonstrate that intra-articular delivery of ivcRNA encoding MSI2 effectively mitigates OA progression in male mice. Furthermore, therapeutic supplementation of SOX5, a downstream effector of MSI2, via ivcRNA delivery further validates this approach. Our findings establish ivcRNA-based protein replacement as a potential RNA therapeutic strategy for osteoarthritis.	Nature communications	26/09/2025
10.1002/cph4.70056	Understanding Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Physical Fatigue	Luo Y, Xu H, Xiong S, Ke J	BACKGROUND: Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is a debilitating illness marked by persistent fatigue, yet its mechanisms remain unclear. Growing evidence implicates immunosenescence-the age-related decline in immune function-in the onset and persistence of fatigue. METHODS: This review synthesizes clinical and experimental data to examine how immunosenescence contributes to ME/CFS. We focus on chronic inflammation, senescent immune phenotypes, mitochondrial dysfunction, and neuroendocrine imbalance, with emphasis on maladaptive crosstalk among immune, muscular, neuroendocrine, and vascular systems. RESULTS: Aging immune cells drive chronic inflammation that impairs mitochondrial ATP production and promotes muscle catabolism. Concurrently, HPA-axis suppression and β(2)-adrenergic dysfunction amplify immune dysregulation and energy imbalance. Together, these processes illustrate how immunosenescence sustains pathological cross-organ signaling underlying systemic fatigue. CONCLUSION: Immunosenescence provides a unifying framework linking immune, metabolic, and neuroendocrine dysfunction in ME/CFS. Recognizing cross-organ communication highlights its clinical relevance, suggesting biomarkers such as cytokines and exhaustion markers, and supports integrated therapeutic strategies targeting immune and metabolic networks.

10.1016/j.lanhl.2025.100763	Integrating exercise and medication management in geriatric care: a holistic	Izquierdo M, Ramírez-Vélez R, Fiatarone Singh MA	Integrating exercise prescriptions with medication management represents a novel approach for enhancing health and function, optimising medication effectiveness, and reducing adverse drug reactions and polypharmacy in older adults (ie, those aged ≥60 years). This Personal View highlights the need for a comprehensive assessment of lifestyle, diagnoses, geriatric syndromes, and medications with an emphasis on fully incorporating exercise treatment into geriatric care. Exercise is an alternative to less effective or unsafe medications for many conditions, including depression, anxiety, insomnia, osteoarthritis, and dementia. Exercise is an important adjunct to pharmacotherapy for many common chronic conditions such as coronary artery disease, heart failure, diabetes, osteoporosis, cancer, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Adding exercise to drug management can mitigate adverse drug reactions, enhance medication compliance, and reduce the adverse effects of sedentary behaviour and ageing processes on chronic disease expression. Targeted exercise programmes have also been shown to ameliorate drug-induced side-effects, including anorexia, falls, sarcopenia, osteoporosis, and orthostatic hypotension, and to overcome constraints such as reduced aerobic fitness, balance impairment, and muscle atrophy due to some medications. Health-care professionals require additional training and support to ensure that exercise assumes a key, central role in older adults with multimorbidity and polypharmacy, as supported by the current literature. This Personal View describes practical approaches to incorporating exercise into clinical practice as a step towards an integrated geriatric care model, with the ultimate aim of increasing health span and minimising disability.

Here we show that ischaemic injury induces persistent microglial activation that perpetuates chronic inflammation, leading to microglial cholesterol accumulation and metabolic reprogramming. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we identified distinct stroke-associated foamy microglia clusters characterized by extensive reprogramming of cholesterol metabolism. Furthermore, direct intracerebral free cholesterol or cholesterol crystal infusion recapitulated sustained microglial activation, directly linking aberrant cholesterol metabolism to prolonged neuroinflammatory responses. Therapeutically, we demonstrate that reducing microglial cholesterol overload through genetic or pharmacological activation of CYP46A1 in male mice promotes white matter repair and functional recovery. These findings highlight microglial cholesterol metabolism as a key driver of post-stroke inflammation, offering therapeutic strategies targeting cholesterol metabolism to mitigate long-term brain damage and promote neurorestoration, potentially improving stroke-related disability outcomes.

10.1016/j.phymed.2025.157301	Integrating metagenomics, lipidomics and proteomics to explore the effect and	Zhao Y, Song T, Ren P, Wu X, Luo Q, Xie J, Lai H, Li X, Wen Y, Liao X, Zhou J	BACKGROUND: The comorbidity of atherosclerosis (AS) and depression presents a significant clinical challenge. Its pathogenesis entails complex abnormalities in inflammatory responses, lipid metabolism, and gut microbiota homeostasis. Ginsenoside Rb1 (GRb1)-a bioactive compound derived from the dried roots of Panax ginseng (Araliaceae)-demonstrates anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, lipid-lowering, and neuroprotective properties. However, GRb1's therapeutic potential and underlying mechanisms in AS co-depression remain inadequately characterized. PURPOSE: This study aims to elucidate the mechanism of GRb1 in AS co-depression disease, identify potential therapeutic targets, and thereby develop novel therapeutic strategies for this condition. METHODS: An AS co-depression comorbidity model was established using ApoE(⁻/⁻) mice fed a high-fat diet and subjected to chronic restraint stress. To evaluate GRb1's therapeutic efficacy, we assessed serum lipid profiles, performed aortic Oil Red O staining, and conducted behavioral tests for depressive-like phenotypes. Furthermore, we employed an integrated multi-omics approach-combining metagenomics, targeted lipid metabolomics, and proteomics-to identify key alterations in gut microbiota, lipid metabolites, and proteins, with subsequent correlation analysis. Key differential proteins and associated pathways identified through multi-omics were validated using both in vivo (AS co-depression mouse model) and in vitro (HT22 cells) experiments. Finally, GRb1's effects on ferroptosis and specific signaling pathways (CD44/Gls2, ACSL4/LPCAT3/ALOX15, SLC7A11/GPX4) were examined via Western blotting, immunofluorescence, and transmission electron microscopy in both mouse tissues and HT22 cells. RESULTS: Proteobacteria, Helicobacter, and Helicobacter_typhlonius represent significant intestinal microbiota components. Their primary differential lipids include phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidylcholine (PC), and lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC), while key differential proteins encompass CD44, Gls2, and Snrpf. Notably, a strong correlation exists among Helicobacter_typhlonius, PE, and CD44. GRb1 modulates PE metabolic dysregulation by reducing the relative abundance of Helicobacter_typhlonius, thereby inhibiting lipid peroxidation and ameliorating oxidative stress. Furthermore, GRb1 suppresses the CD44/Gls2 axis, ACSL4/LPCAT3/ALOX15 pathway, and activates the SLC7A11/GPX4-mediated ferroptosis pathway, thereby exerting its anti-AS co-depression effects through these multi-target mechanisms. CONCLUSION: GRb1 regulates the intestinal microbiota, abnormal lipid metabolism, modulates protein function, inhibits lipid peroxidation, improves oxidative stress, inhibits ferroptosis, regulates the CD44/Gls2, ACSL4/LPCAT3/ALOX15, SLC7A11/ GPX4 signaling pathways, and prevents the progression of AS co-depression disease.

Large trials are needed to assess safety and effectiveness. METHODS: For this open-label, randomized, two-by-two factorial trial at 20 sites in the United Kingdom, we enrolled participants with non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis who had frequent pulmonary exacerbations and daily sputum production. Current smokers and persons who had recently received mucoactive treatments were excluded. All participants received standard care and were also assigned either to one of three mucoactive-drug groups - hypertonic saline (the hypertonic-saline group), hypertonic saline and carbocisteine (the combination group), or carbocisteine (the carbocisteine group) - or to standard care alone. The comparisons were between hypertonic saline and no hypertonic saline and between carbocisteine and no carbocisteine, with each category consisting of two groups. The primary outcome was the number of pulmonary exacerbations over a 52-week period. Key secondary outcomes were scores on disease-specific health-related quality-of-life assessments, time to next pulmonary exacerbation, and safety. RESULTS: A total of 288 participants underwent randomization. No treatment interactions were found. The mean number of adjudicated fully qualifying pulmonary exacerbations over the 52-week period was 0.76 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.58 to 0.95) with hypertonic saline as compared with 0.98 (95% CI, 0.78 to 1.19) with no hypertonic saline (adjusted between-group difference in the means, -0.25 [95% CI, -0.57 to 0.07; P = 0.12]) and 0.86 (95% CI, 0.66 to 1.06) with carbocisteine as compared with 0.90 (95% CI, 0.70 to 1.09) with no carbocisteine (adjusted between-group difference in the means, -0.04 [95% CI, -0.36 to 0.28; P = 0.81]). Secondary outcomes and the incidence of adverse events, including serious adverse events, were similar across the groups. CONCLUSIONS: In participants with bronchiectasis, neither hypertonic saline nor carbocisteine significantly reduced the mean incidence of pulmonary exacerbations over a period of 52 weeks.

10.1016/j.enfcli.2011.09.005	[Effectiveness of pre-operative education in reducing anxiety in surgical	Díez-Álvarez E, Arrospide A, Mar J, Alvarez U, Belaustegi A, Lizaur B, Larrañaga A, Arana JM	OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of a structured pre-operative interview conducted by operating room nurses in order to reduce the pre-operative anxiety of patients, and to determine the profile of patients who can benefit from it. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A randomised double-blind and prospective trial was conducted on a sample of 335 patients scheduled for surgery in two regional hospitals in the Basque Region of Spain, Alto Deba Hospital and Mendaro Hospital. We compared the alternative of using a structured briefing (test group) with the current situation without any formal intervention (control group). The effectiveness of the procedure was determined using the STAI state anxiety self-assessment questionnaire. The Chi-squared statistic was used to assess the differences in factors and the Student t-test for comparison of means in the continuous variables. RESULTS: The impact of the intervention on measures of state anxiety and trait anxiety was found to be not statistically significant, although the mean state anxiety state was slightly lower in the intervention group (18.96) than in the controls (20.03). Women undergoing surgery in the specialty of gynaecology showed the higher state anxiety compared with other specialties. As regards trait anxiety a higher ASA level is associated with higher anxiety. Furthermore, the consumption of psychotropic drugs is also related to a higher level of trait anxiety. CONCLUSION: The preoperative visit can be helpful when patients are selected according to specific characteristics: by type of anaesthesia, gender, or type of surgery. There may also be beneficial effects when preoperative education is tailored according to patient's anxiety risk. The time immediately before surgery may not be the best time for conducting the visit, as this may make the patients more anxious.	Enfermeria clinica	01/02/2012
10.1007/s00520-025-09918-4	Strategies for premedication and G-CSF application in sacituzumab govitecan	Pieniążek M, Polakiewicz-Gilowska A, Kubeczko M, Las-Jankowska M, Pacholczak-Madej R, Kilian-Van Miegem P, Ziobro M, Łacko A, Jarząb M, Püsküllüoğlu M	BACKGROUND: Sacituzumab govitecan (SG) is approved for advanced triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) in the second-line setting and beyond, offering improved survival compared to chemotherapy. Adverse events (AEs) commonly include myelosuppression, gastrointestinal disturbances, and hepatic toxicity. Effective premedication and prophylaxis are critical for AE management. This study assessed premedication protocols for SG-treated TNBC patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective cohort study across five oncology centers in Poland analyzed premedication regimens for patients completing SG treatment by October 2024. Premedication evaluated included acetaminophen, corticosteroids, antihistamines, 5-HT3 and NK1 receptor antagonists, and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) when needed. AEs were assessed using National Cancer Institute-Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 5.0. RESULTS: Among 67 patients with TNBC who finished their treatment with SG, the mean age at SG initiation was 51.5 ± 12.4 years. Premedication in the first cycle included corticosteroids and 5-HT3 receptor antagonists in 66 (99%) and 65 (97%) patients, respectively; acetaminophen in 57 patients (85%), H1 blockers in 53 patients (79%), and H2 blockers in 52 patients (78%). G-CSF was used as primary prophylaxis in 27 patients (40%) and required in 53 patients (79%) during treatment. Atropine premedication was needed in 4 patients (6%) for grade 3 diarrhea as secondary prophylaxis. CONCLUSIONS: Most patients received standardized premedication regimens, but significant variability was observed in G-CSF use for neutropenia prophylaxis. Only 6% of patients required atropine as diarrhea premedication. Practices regarding the use of G-CSF varied across centers, reflecting evolving SmPC guidance and individual risk-based approaches to neutropenia management.

Here, we investigate the link between unresolved parenchymal inflammation and cellular senescence in MS progression. Single-cell transcriptomic analysis of human brain tissue reveals an accumulation of senescent-like glial cells in diseased white matter, especially in chronic active lesions, and to a lesser extent in the cortex. Spatial transcriptomics show gradients of senescence-like signatures extending from lesion cores to periplaque regions, alongside rewired cellular networks. Experimental induction of senescence in MS hiPSC-derived neural organoids demonstrates that microglia are especially vulnerable to inflammation-induced senescence, which can be partially rescued by CNS-penetrant anti-inflammatory drugs. At the patient level (n = 466), increased 3T MRI-estimated brain-age is observed, especially in individuals with more than four chronic active lesions. These findings suggest that chronic inflammation might accelerate senescence-like processes, potentially contributing to disease progression, and that its modulation might help limit further propagation.

10.1186/s40001-025-03122-0	Association between asthma and thyroid function as well as thyroid hormone	Li K, Ding Q, Liu R, Lin S, Qiu R, Wu G	OBJECTIVE: Thyroid hormones significantly influence multiple physiological systems, particularly the respiratory system. Despite limited research on asthma-thyroid associations, emerging studies have begun exploring this link. This cross-sectional study investigates relationships between asthma, thyroid function, and thyroid hormone sensitivity in U.S. adults using NHANES data. METHODS: A total of 8160 participants were included in this study. Weighted analyses of data from the 2007-2012 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) were performed to examine the associations between asthma, thyroid function, and thyroid hormone sensitivity indices. Subgroup analyses and ROC curve investigations were also conducted. Additionally, a retrospective cohort of 30 asthma patients and 30 non-asthmatic controls seen at Zhongshan Hospital, Xiamen University between July 2023 and July 2025 was extracted; FT3 levels were compared and asthma control was evaluated across FT3 tertiles. Thyroid function parameters assessed were as follows: free triiodothyronine (FT3), free thyroxine (FT4), total triiodothyronine (TT3), total thyroxine (TT4), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), thyroid peroxidase antibody (TPOAb), thyroglobulin antibody (TgAb), and thyroglobulin (Tg). Thyroid hormone sensitivity indices-namely, the FT3/FT4 ratio, thyrotroph T4 resistance index (TT4RI), thyroid-stimulating hormone index (TSHI), and thyroid feedback quantile index (TFQI)-were calculated from serum FT3, FT4, and TSH values. RESULTS: Asthmatics exhibited higher FT3 and FT3/FT4 levels but lower TPOAb than non-asthmatics. However, adjusted models (2 and 3) revealed an inverse association between asthma risk and FT3/FT4 (β: - 0.05, 95% CI - 0.09 to - 0.01). Quartile stratification maintained this inverse trend, with significant dose-response relationships in unadjusted Model 1 (P < 0.05). Subgroup analyses showed Mexican American asthmatics had lower FT3 and FT3/FT4 levels. ROC curves indicated superior predictive accuracy for TPOAb (AUC = 0.60) compared to FT3/FT4. Our institutional validation revealed that asthma patients had significantly lower FT3 levels than controls, and higher FT3 was associated with a lower proportion of acute exacerbations; however, the trend did not reach statistical significance. CONCLUSION: FT3 and FT3/FT4 levels may inversely correlate with asthma risk, though causality remains unclear due to study design limitations. Further research is warranted.

10.1038/s42003-025-08841-y	Isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase depletion reveals vulnerabilities in Mycobacterium	Luo D, Xie W, Wang C, Sun Y, Zhang L, Qian L, Zhang J, Dang G, Liu S, Wang Z	Mycobacterium abscessus and Mycobacterium marinum are nontuberculous mycobacteria that pose significant challenges due to their high drug resistance and persistence in hostile host environments. Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, such as isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase (IleRS), are crucial for protein synthesis and represent promising targets for antimicrobial development. This study investigates the role of IleRS in mycobacterial growth, metabolism, and pathogenesis using conditional gene silencing combined with microbiological, metabolomic, and transcriptomic analyses. Our findings indicate that IleRS is essential for mycobacterial growth and survival during infection. Depletion of IleRS disrupts branched-chain amino acid and pantothenate biosynthesis, leading to metabolic vulnerabilities and impaired persistence in macrophages and in mouse infection models. Based on our metabolic findings, we tested drug susceptibility and found that depletion of IleRS enhances sensitivity to pyrazinamide, highlighting a synergistic effect that could improve tuberculosis treatment. Furthermore, global gene set enrichment analysis reveals that IleRS knockdown might promote bacterial clearance by upregulating cholesterol metabolism and lysosome organization processes in macrophages. These results establish IleRS as a potential therapeutic target, offering new insights into reducing drug resistance and enhancing current treatment regimens for mycobacterial infections, including tuberculosis.

Hansen JN, Sun H, Kahnert K, Westenius E, Johannesson A, Villegas C, Le T, Tzavlaki K, Winsnes C, Pohjanen E, Mäkiniemi A, Fall J, Ballllosera Navarro F, Bäckström A, Lindskog C, Johansson F, von Feilitzen K, Delgado-Vega AM, Martinez Casals A, Mahdessian D, Uhlén M, Sheu SH, Lindstrand A, Axelsson U, Lundberg E	Primary cilia are critical organelles found on most human cells. Their dysfunction is linked to hereditary ciliopathies with a wide phenotypic spectrum. Despite their significance, the specific roles of cilia in different cell types remain poorly understood due to limitations in analyzing ciliary protein composition. We employed antibody-based spatial proteomics to expand the Human Protein Atlas to primary cilia. Our analysis identified the subciliary locations of 715 proteins across three cell lines, examining 128,156 individual cilia. We found that 69% of the ciliary proteome is cell-type specific, and 78% exhibited single-cilia heterogeneity. Our findings portray cilia as sensors tuning their proteome to effectively sense the environment and compute cellular responses. We reveal 91 cilia proteins and found a genetic candidate variant in CREB3 in one clinical case with features overlapping ciliopathy phenotypes. This open, spatial cilia atlas advances research on cilia and ciliopathies.	Cell	25/09/2025
10.1038/s41413-025-00456-7	Unraveling the mechanisms of bone diseases: targeting dendritic cells in	Chen Y, Wang S, Chen X, Wu Z, He F, Chen Q	Bone repair and regeneration is a complex spatiotemporal process recruiting a variety of cell types, which need to precisely mediated for effective healing post-damage. The concept of osteoimmunology emphasizes the extensive and intricate crosstalk between the bone and the immune system. Despite the significant advancements in understanding osteoimmunology, the precise role of dendritic cells (DCs) in this field remains under investigation. As key antigen-presenting cells, DCs are critical in orchestrating adaptive immune responses and maintaining tissue homeostasis. Recent researches have further revealed the potential of DCs to influence the development or acceleration of inflammatory and autoimmune bone disease, as well as their interaction with skeletal cells in the context of bone repair and regeneration. Therefore, an in-depth understanding of DCs in the osteoimmunology would be valuable. Herein, we discuss the effects of DCs on bone homeostasis and bone-related diseases (i.e., rheumatoid arthritis (RA), periodontitis, bone regeneration, and other bone abnormalities diseases), and introduce the innovative DCs-targeting biomaterials, aimed at promoting bone repair and regeneration. Furthermore, we summarize the underlying crosstalk between DCs and other cells (i.e., osteoclasts, mesenchymal stromal stem cells (MSCs), hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs), T and B cells) in the bone homeostasis and bone-related diseases. In conclusion, we propose that osteoimmunology offers a promising perspective for unraveling the mechanisms of bone-related diseases; meanwhile, targeting DCs from the perspective of osteoimmunology may provide innovative ideas and resolutions to achieve the internal homeostasis balance.

To shed light on the molecular pathogenetic processes underlying the exordium and contribution of gliosis to disease onset and progression, we used cells, mice, and patient-derived cells modeling TDP-43, SOD1, and C9orf72-linked and sporadic ALS. Our data reveal a sequential disease progression, starting with enhanced glial reactivity and proliferation, and transitioning into inflammation with upregulation of pro-inflammatory genes. Using mouse genetics, we show that expression of mutant TDP-43 in astrocytes is necessary to cause gliosis and behavioral abnormalities. Mechanistically, we show that glial MYC gain-of-function drives neurodegeneration by promoting the release of astrocyte-derived EVs that nonetheless fail to provide trophic support to surrounding neurons. Our research reveals a novel functional role for MYC in glia-to-neuron miscommunication in ALS.	Brain : a journal of neurology	26/09/2025
10.1080/19490976.2025.2558071	Systemic and gut microbiome changes with metformin and liraglutide in youth-onset	Glaros SB, Mishra SP, Jain S, Davis FS, Gabel SA, Mueller GA, Jarmusch AK, Mabundo L, Courville AB, Walter MF, Walter PJ, Overdahl KE, Yadav H, Chung ST	Metformin (Met) and liraglutide (Lira) are preferred diabetes therapies that may improve glycemia by modulating the gut microbiome, but the mechanisms and pathways are unknown and few data exist in youth-onset type 2 diabetes (Y-T2D). In a 3-month parallel clinical trial in African American Y-T2D randomized to Met (n = 14) or Met+Lira (n = 11), we compared gut microbial composition and metabolomic profiles and determined the relationship of changes in microbial abundance with glycemia and plasma metabolites. After 3 months, Met was associated with greater relative abundance of Eubacterium and Eubacterium rectale and lower Bacteroides ovates (p < 0.05). Met+Lira was associated with greater Bacteroides fragilis and lower Streptococcus thermophilus (p < 0.05). Met group had increased (>1.5-fold) plasma cholic secondary bile acids (sulfochenodeoxycholic acid, nutriacholic acid, alpha-muricholic acid, and C24 dihydroxy bile acid; p ≤ 0.002). The change in nutriacholic acid correlated with lower fasting glucose (r = -0.7, p < 0.05). Shifts in microbiota taxa were not associated with plasma short-chain fatty acids (SCFA), hemoglobin A1c or glucose. Short-term Met and Met+Lira in Y-T2D were related to distinct shifts toward bile acid and SCFA-producing gut microbiota taxa, and secondary bile acid metabolites correlated with improved glycemia, suggesting bile acid pathways may be important modulators of glycemia in youth on metformin.Clinical trials.gov identifier: NCT02960659.

Although cell-free infection of epithelial cells is inefficient, direct B-epithelial cell contact infection is highly efficient and probably the dominant route. To identify mechanisms of contact-mediated infection, we implemented a genome-wide CRISPR screen and uncovered desmocollin 2 (DSC2) as an EBV epithelial receptor and DSC3 as a co-factor for infection. DSC2 and DSC3 double knockout significantly inhibited both cell-free and cell-cell contact EBV infection of normal oral keratinocytes, while their overexpression permitted infection in receptor-negative cells. Antibodies to DSC2 blocked infection across normal oral keratinocytes, primary oral keratinocytes, and head and neck epithelial organoids. Combining DSC2 and DSC3 antibodies efficiently blocked cell-cell contact infection. Mechanistically, DSC2 interacted with the EBV gH/gL glycoprotein and facilitated epithelial fusion. Notably, EphA2 overexpression failed to restore infection in DSC2/3-deficient cells, indicating its dependence on DSC2/3. Our findings establish DSC2 as a principal EBV entry receptor and target for vaccine and therapeutic development.	Nature microbiology	26/09/2025
10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.125.075150	Targeting Calcium Regulation for Heart Failure and Arrhythmia Therapeutics: A	Redel-Traub G, Marx SO, Marks AR	Despite advances in pharmacologic and procedural therapies, heart failure (HF) and cardiac arrhythmias remain significant global health burdens, highlighting the urgent need for novel therapeutic strategies. Defective Ca(2+) handling in cardiac myocytes is recognized as a central pathogenic mechanism underlying both heart failure and atrial and ventricular arrhythmias. In this review, we critically assess the current state of research on Ca(2+)-handling proteins and their role in causing heart failure and arrhythmias, highlighting therapeutic implications. Recent paradigm-shifting discoveries, clinical trial outcomes, and challenges of targeting Ca(2+)-handling proteins are examined. As outlined in this review, an improved understanding of the relevant proteins and their differential expression and function in human health and disease is crucial for developing Ca(2+) handling-targeted therapeutics that can fundamentally alter the natural history of heart failure and arrhythmias.

10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.125.074959	Single-Cell Splicing Isoform Atlas of the Adult Human Heart and Heart Failure.	Pan T, Lu L, Youker K, Shiau CK, Wang M, Lin HY, Nguyen A, He Y, Tong E, Zhu P, Ranka R, Yan Y, Sinha A, Bharat A, Eagar T, Wilcox J, Bhimaraj A, Gao R	BACKGROUND: Alternative splicing plays crucial roles in normal heart development and cardiac disease by influencing protein-coding sequences, functional domains, and molecular networks. However, a detailed characterization of the human heart isoform landscape remains incomplete. METHODS: Leveraging long-read single-nucleus RNA sequencing and computational analysis, we dissected full-length isoform heterogeneities, expression patterns, and usage shifts across cell types, cell states, and cardiac conditions of the adult left ventricle. We applied in silico approaches to assess the functional relevance of identified isoforms; validated isoform compositions of representative cardiac genes using reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction and targeted amplicon sequencing; and developed a web server for interactive navigation of our results. RESULTS: The data revealed that isoform heterogeneity is widespread in the cardiac cellular system, serving as a posttranscriptional buffer system that calibrates the molecule reservoirs in human hearts. In healthy left ventricles, ≈30% of cell type-specific genes were polyform, using multiple isoforms tailored to cell type-specific programs. Among ubiquitously expressed genes, >300 showed differential isoform usage with cell type specificity. Compared with heart failure, 379 genes in cardiomyocytes demonstrated marked isoform usage shifts, most of which are predicted to change protein coding outcomes through direct changes in protein coding sequences and switches between intron retention and non-protein-coding biotypes. In contrast, cell state-specific programs tend to operate on monoform genes associated with changes among cell states. In addition, our data revealed heart failure-associated differential isoform usage events in stromal and immune cell types in the cardiac microenvironment. CONCLUSIONS: We present a comprehensive atlas of splicing isoforms in the normal adult heart and heart failure through long-read single-nucleus RNA sequencing and comprehensive computational analyses. The results suggest crucial roles of isoforms in buffering core cellular programs and contributing to disease-associated cell states. The full-length details of these cell-specific isoforms serve as an important reference for downstream translational and mechanistic studies and are available on our online data portal at https://github.com/gaolabtools/heart-isoform-atlas.

As atezolizumab plus bevacizumab has become a first-line therapy for advanced HCC, understanding the real-world outcomes of TBP is increasingly relevant. METHODS: We conducted a multicenter retrospective observational study involving 122 patients with unresectable HCC treated with atezolizumab plus bevacizumab across nine liver centers in Japan. Among patients who experienced radiologic progressive disease (PD), clinical outcomes were compared between those who continued treatment beyond progression (TBP group) and those who discontinued therapy. Overall survival (OS), tumor response, and subgroup analyses based on major vessel involvement (MVI) were evaluated. RESULTS: Among patients with PD, the median OS was not reached in the TBP group, compared to 13.6 months in the non-TBP group (HR 2.04; 95% CI 1.02-4.07; p=0.0435). When stratified by MVI status, patients without MVI who received TBP had significantly longer OS (median not reached) than those who received palliative care (median 6.2 months; HR 11.2; 95% CI 3.89-32.5; p<0.001). Among patients with MVI, TBP did not confer an OS benefit over palliative care (median OS: 10.4 months vs. 7.4 months; HR 2.24; p=0.260), whereas switching to subsequent chemotherapy showed improved OS (median 23.1 months vs. 7.4 months; HR 7.33; 95% CI 1.44-37.3; p=0.0164). Multivariate analysis identified MVI as an independent negative prognostic factor (HR 5.17; 95% CI 1.34-20.0; p=0.0172), even after adjusting for AFP ratio at progression. CONCLUSIONS: This multicenter study suggests that continuation of atezolizumab plus bevacizumab beyond radiologic progression may improve survival outcomes in selected patients with unresectable HCC, particularly those without major vessel involvement. These findings support the integration of TBP into personalized treatment strategies in advanced HCC.	Frontiers in immunology	01/01/2025
10.1007/s00262-025-04143-8	Efficacy and safety of two-year fixed versus continuous immune checkpoint	Pandey T, Bhatti SA	BACKGROUND: The optimal duration of immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy in advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (amNSCLC) is unknown. Most trials either continued ICI indefinitely or electively stopped at two years if no progressive disease (PD) or treatment-limiting immune-related adverse events (irAEs) emerged. METHODS: A systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and real-world evidence studies (RWEs) was performed for adults with amNSCLC treated with ICI therapy up to August 24, 2024. Patients were divided into two cohorts: a 2 year fixed cohort in which ICI therapy was discontinued after 2 years and a continuous therapy cohort in which ICI therapy was continued beyond 2 years. RESULTS: Twenty studies and 5027 patients were included. The 5-year overall survival (OS) rates of the two-year fixed cohorts ranged from 69 to 83% across studies and were comparable to continuous therapy cohorts. Four RWEs compared survival outcomes between 2 year fixed and continuous cohorts and found no difference. Patients who completed 2 years of therapy in RCTs tended to have greater rates of irAEs compared to the baseline RCT population. Three RWEs reported higher rates of irAEs in the continuous versus two-year fixed cohorts. Many patients who developed PD after the two-year mark in both cohorts remained alive at the data cutoff. Larger/academic centers favored two-year fixed therapy compared with community centers. CONCLUSION: Survival outcomes after ICI discontinuation at 2 years are comparable to continuous therapy in amNSCLC. IrAEs tend to accumulate over time.

10.3390/jcdd12090363	Association of Pan-Immune-Inflammation Value with All-Cause and Cardiovascular	Liu Q, Yang W, Zhang R, Guo X, Wei Y	BACKGROUND: Inflammatory responses critically impact long-term outcomes in myocardial infarction (MI) survivors, yet few biomarkers comprehensively evaluate systemic immune-inflammatory status. This study assessed the prognostic utility of a novel marker-the pan-immune-inflammation value (PIV)-for predicting all-cause and cardiovascular mortality post-MI. METHODS: Using the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data (2001-2018), 1559 MI survivors were included. PIV was calculated as (neutrophils × platelets × monocytes)/lymphocytes. Weighted Cox models assessed the association between log-transformed PIV (LnPIV) and mortality. Restricted cubic spline (RCS) models explored non-linear dose-response relationships, and predictive performance was evaluated via time-dependent ROC analysis. RESULTS: Over a median 75-month follow-up, 675 deaths occurred. LnPIV showed significant non-linear associations with all-cause (p < 0.0001) and cardiovascular mortality (p = 0.0471). When LnPIV ≥ 5.59, each unit increase was associated with an 85% (HR = 1.85, 95% CI: 1.49-2.28) higher all-cause mortality risk; for cardiovascular mortality, the risk increased by 77% (HR = 1.77, 95% CI: 1.20-2.63) when LnPIV ≥ 5.68. Time-dependent ROC analysis confirmed strong prediction above these thresholds. CONCLUSION: PIV demonstrates threshold-dependent mortality risk stratification in MI patients, particularly effective in high-inflammatory subgroups, offering a potential tool for personalized risk stratification.

10.1016/j.medcli.2025.107184	GLP-1-based therapies for obesity: Impact on comorbidities or obesity-related	Vilarrasa N, Pellitero S	Agents targeting the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) are effective in managing metabolic conditions associated with obesity, such as obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), and chronic kidney disease (CKD). In OSA, studies with first generation GLP-1R agonists (ArGLP-1) and co-agonists (GLP-1/GIP) have demonstrated significant improvements in the apnea-hypopnea index and weight reduction. In MASLD, GLP-1RAs and co-agonists (GLP-1/GIP or GLP-1/glucagon) have shown efficacy in reducing hepatic fat, improving fibrosis, and resolving steatohepatitis, with promising results from trials such as ESSENCE and SYNERGY-NASH. In CKD, semaglutide has been associated with a reduction in renal events and slower disease progression. Beyond their metabolic and cardiovascular benefits, these agents represent a comprehensive approach to treating obesity and its complications, with ongoing research exploring their potential indications in chronic inflammatory diseases such as psoriasis and hidradenitis suppurativa.

10.1016/j.jacc.2025.08.047	Inflammation and Cardiovascular Disease: 2025 ACC Scientific Statement: A Report	Mensah GA, Arnold N, Prabhu SD, Ridker PM, Welty FK	The crucial role of inflammation in the pathogenesis and clinical outcomes of cardiovascular disease (CVD) has recently gained increased attention. In particular, residual inflammation, measured with high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) remains strongly predictive of recurrent events, even in statin-treated patients. Similarly, elevated hsCRP in apparently healthy individuals identifies a higher-risk group in whom statin therapy significantly reduces the risk of first major CVD events even if LDL-cholesterol is normal. This report provides an updated understanding of the role of chronic, low-grade inflammation in CVD and highlights new seminal research findings, especially in atherosclerosis, myocardial infarction, heart failure, and pericarditis. Consensus recommendations are summarized for screening, evaluation, and CVD risk assessment; inflammatory biomarkers in cardiovascular imaging; inflammation inhibition in behavioral and lifestyle risks; and anti-inflammatory approaches in primary and secondary prevention as well as in heart failure and other CVDs. This report also addresses current challenges and future opportunities. For example, it cautions that not all trials of anti-inflammatory therapy in secondary prevention have been successful and such trial evidence is needed before broad recommendations for other agents can be made. Additionally, in successful trials, the interplay between inflammation and key physiological systems often remains incompletely examined. Another promising area of research is the role that novel special pro-resolving bioactive lipid molecules play in promoting the resolution of inflammation and CVD risk reduction. In aggregate, the evidence linking inflammation with atherosclerotic CVD is no longer exploratory but is compelling and clinically actionable. The time for taking action has now arrived.

10.1002/advs.202509781	Procyanidin B3 and Its Derivatives Alleviate Neuronal Injury by Targeting G3BP1	Zhang H, Zhang Y, Chen Y, Zhong W, Tan S, Wang J, Yan H, Yan N, Lin M, Liu X, Chang J	Ischemic stroke (IS) is a leading cause of mortality and disability worldwide, but effective therapeutic options are limited. In this study, a chemical proteomic strategy is employed using the active compound procyanidin B3 (PB3) as a chemical probe to identify the therapeutic targets for IS. It is discovered that the Ras GTPase-activating protein SH3 domain-binding protein 1 (G3BP1) is a key target of PB3, which exerts a neuroprotective effect by inhibiting the degradation of stress granules and reducing apoptosis. Based on this finding, 14 PB3 derivatives are designed and synthesized, among which compound 6c exhibited potent neuroprotective activity and favorable blood-brain barrier permeability. This study not only establishes G3BP1 as a promising therapeutic target for IS but also highlights the potential of PB3 and its derivatives for the development of IS therapeutic agents.

Here, we developed an oral genome-editing platform (TPGS-RNP@LNP), where Lsd1-targeting ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) were encapsulated in mulberry leaf lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) and formulated with d-α-tocopherol polyethylene glycol succinate (TPGS). TPGS reinforced the lipid bilayer of LNPs, enhanced gastrointestinal stability, and facilitated colonic mucus penetration. Upon the galactose receptor-mediated endocytosis of TPGS-RNP@LNPs by macrophages, their fusion with the endosomal membrane and the presence of nuclear localization signals ensured the nuclear delivery of RNPs. TPGS-RNP@LNPs achieved 59.7% Lsd1 editing efficiency in macrophages, surpassing the commercial CRISPRMAX (43.0%). Oral TPGS-RNP@LNPs promoted H3K4 methylation to modulate epigenetic states, achieving inflammation mitigation, epithelial barrier restoration, and retardation of colitis and its associated tumorigenesis. As an LNP-based oral RNP delivery system, TPGS-RNP@LNPs provide a promising platform for precise treatment of colorectal diseases.	Science advances	26/09/2025
10.1186/s13020-025-01189-9	Salvianolic acid B and Senkyunolide I synergistically alleviate cardiac	Liu C, Guo R, Zhou Y, Zhu M, Shao L, Wang Y, Zhao L	BACKGROUND: Cardiac hypertrophy, characterized by the thickening of the heart muscle, arises from factors such as hypertension and genetic mutations, often leading to adverse outcomes like heart failure and arrhythmias. Guanxinning tablets (GXNT), a botanical drug composed of the blood-activating herbs Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge. and Ligusticum striatum DC., are widely used in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. However, the active ingredients and their molecular mechanisms are yet to be fully understood. METHODS: We evaluated the anti-hypertrophic effects of GXNT and screened its active substances via cardiac function live-imaging on an aristolochic acid A-stimulated zebrafish cardiac hypertrophy model, and through F-actin immunostaining on a phenylephrine-induced hypertrophic NRCMs model. Additionally, the protective effects of GXNT's active substances were analyzed in a mouse model of cardiac hypertrophy using echocardiography, histopathology analysis, and western blotting. RESULTS: The anti-hypertrophic effects of GXNT were assessed using an aristolochic acid A-stimulated zebrafish model and phenylephrine-induced hypertrophic NRCMs. GXNT demonstrated significant anti-hypertrophic effects in both models. Phenotypic screening identified Senkyunolide I (Sen I) from Ligusticum striatum as the active component in the zebrafish model, while Salvianolic acid B (Sal B) and Rosmarinic acid from Salvia miltiorrhiza emerged as the key anti-hypertrophic compound in NRCMs. In a mouse model of isoproterenol-induced cardiac hypertrophy, Sal B and Sen I showed synergistic effects, improving cardiac function, reducing oxidative stress, and suppressing inflammation. Mechanistically, transcriptomic sequencing highlighted cooperative modulation of MAP3K1 signaling by the two compounds. Notably, siRNA-mediated knockdown of MAP3K1 in cardiomyocytes attenuated the hypertrophic phenotype, supporting its essential role in the pathological process. Molecular docking and dynamic simulations further supported their binding potential to MAP3K1. CONCLUSION: These findings underscore GXNT's potent anti-hypertrophic effects, possibly driven by the synergistic actions of Sal B and Sen I, and offer insights into its therapeutic potential through MAP3K1 signaling regulation.

Bot A, Scharenberg A, Friedman K, Guey L, Hofmeister R, Andorko JI, Klichinsky M, Neumann F, Shah JV, Swayer AJ, Trudeau K, Weissman D, Stephan MT, Buchholz CJ, June CH	Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy has transformed the outcomes of patients with haematological malignancies, yet its use is limited by labour-intensive manufacturing, constrained production capacity and variable clinical performance. In vivo CAR-T cell engineering, in which CAR-T cells are generated directly inside the patient's body, seeks to overcome these challenges by eliminating the need for ex vivo cell processing and complex logistics, as well as improve clinical performance. Recent advances in virology, RNA medicines and nanotechnology have catalysed a radical overhaul of this approach, which uses targeted delivery systems such as lentiviral vectors and lipid nanoparticles to introduce CAR-encoding genetic material into endogenous T cells. Early clinical studies have shown efficient transduction, sustained CAR expression and initial signs of antitumour activity, establishing proof of concept. This Review explores the underlying technologies - including RNA delivered by lipid nanoparticles and engineered viral vectors - and discusses how they are being adapted to develop more broadly applicable, scalable, safe and effective CAR-T cell therapies. By removing the need for ex vivo manipulation and chemotherapeutic conditioning, this strategy could enable the wider application of CAR-T cell therapies not just to blood cancers but to autoimmune diseases for which ex vivo CAR-T cell therapies have shown strong promise, such as systemic lupus erythematosus.

10.1007/s00280-025-04822-4	Non-oncologic to oncologic drug: A systematic review of drug repurposing in	Dhanush Y, Ganesh VS	PURPOSE: This systematic review investigates drug repurposing as a strategy to accelerate and improve cancer treatment by specifically examining how existing medications can effectively target the established hallmarks of cancer. The research explores how repurposed drugs can address the challenges of conventional cancer drug development, including high costs, lengthy development timelines, and frequent clinical failures. METHODS: The review systematically analyzes repurposed drugs with their ability to target specific cancer hallmarks, including oncogenic signaling pathways, cell death regulation, metabolic reprogramming, growth suppressor reactivation, phenotypic plasticity, antitumor immunity, telomerase activity, angiogenesis, inflammation, cellular senescence, invasion and metastasis, DNA damage response, microbiome modulation, and epigenetic regulation. RESULTS: The analysis identified several promising repurposed medications targeting specific cancer hallmarks: artemisinin derivatives for oncogenic signalling, niclosamide for cell death pathways, leflunomide for metabolic dysregulation, statins for tumour suppressor reactivation, metformin for phenotypic plasticity, liothyronine for immune activation, PARP inhibitors for replication, itraconazole for angiogenesis, celecoxib for inflammation, BCL-2 inhibitors for senescence, fluoroquinolones for metastasis, spironolactone for DNA damage, isoliquiritigenin for microbiome modulation, and various agents targeting non-mutational epigenetic regulation. CONCLUSION: Drug repurposing represents an intriguing approach for addressing the limitations of traditional cancer drug development while effectively targeting the fundamental hallmarks of cancer. By leveraging existing medications with established safety profiles, this strategy offers potential for more rapid translation to clinical applications and may enhance the therapeutic arsenal against various cancer types.

This study aimed to compare the autonomic effects of pulsed field ablation (PFA) versus thermal ablation (TA) in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) through a pooled-analysis. METHODS: A systematic search of PubMed and Embase was conducted through April 5, 2025, to identify comparative studies. The primary outcome was increase-in-heart-rate (IHR) after ablation, and the secondary outcome was increase in serum S100B (IS100B), a marker of neural injury. RESULTS: Eight studies involving 1007 AF patients were included (mean age: 63,39 ± 10,75 years; 36.3% female; maximum follow-up: 12 months). Baseline characteristics, including the use of antiarrhythmic drugs, were similar between the PFA and TA groups. Pooled-analysis showed that PFA was associated with a significantly lower IHR compared to TA (PFA: 4.41 ± 8.86 bpm vs. TA: 10.81 ± 10.46 bpm; p < 0.00001). This difference persisted at midterm (3-6 months) and long-term (12 months) follow-up and remained consistent across age, sex, and different TA modalities (cryoballoon vs. radiofrequency). Correspondingly, the IS100B was significantly less pronounced after PFA (PFA: 33.27 ± 9.46 pg/ml vs. TA: 97.53 ± 31.88 pg/ml; p < 0.00001).

10.1177/17534666251379586	A clinical predictive model for the long-term survival of progressive fibrosis	Gu JM, Xiao SY, Chen BT, Kang ST, Li WC, Zhang MY, Yu Y, Han GL	BACKGROUND: In patients with chronic fibrosing interstitial lung disease (ILD), some may develop a progressive fibrosing (PF) phenotype, which presents as rapid progression and often results in poor clinical outcomes. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to construct and test a model to identify independent predictors of mortality in PF-ILD and to trace the lung function trajectory of patients with PF-ILD. DESIGN: This multicenter retrospective cohort study enrolled patients with PF-ILD from two distinct centers with 8-year follow-up to develop and validate a prognostic nomogram based on clinical factors and assess longitudinal lung function trajectories. METHODS: We enrolled patients diagnosed with PF-ILD from China-Japan Friendship Hospital (training cohort) and Jiulongpo Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine (validation cohort). Survival status was recorded during the 8-year follow-up period. Clinical demographics, laboratory data, pulmonary function test (PFT) results, and high-resolution computed tomography results were collected for analysis. A training cohort of patients with PF-ILD was used to identify predictors of mortality, which were then validated in an external cohort. A nomogram was established based on multivariate factors. The predictive performance of the model was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic curves and calibration curves. Survival estimates were performed using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared using the log-rank test. The PFT trajectory was estimated using a linear mixed model. RESULTS: A total of 1419 patients with PF-ILD from China-Japan Friendship Hospital (training cohort) and 282 patients with PF-ILD from Jiulongpo Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine (validation cohort) were enrolled. During the 8-year follow-up, 150 (10.57%) patients received lung transplantation, while 43.55% (n = 618) of cases reached mortality, with a median survival time of 53 months in the BJ cohort. A predictive model was built based on ILD subgroups, baseline Forced Vital Capacity%(pred) (FVC%pred), baseline Diffusing Capacity of the Lung for Carbon Monoxide%(pred) (DLCO%pred), age at diagnosis, antifibrosis treatment, gastroesophageal reflux complication, C-Reactive Protein levels, and BMI. We also found AEs and progressive declines in FVC and DLCO, particularly after the third year post-diagnosis, were strongly associated with poor prognosis and may serve as important longitudinal biomarkers for risk stratification in PF-ILD. CONCLUSION: A predictive model incorporating multiple factors effectively predicted 8-year survival in patients with PF-ILD. In addition to these baseline predictors, AEs and progressive declines in FVC and DLCO were strongly associated with poor prognosis and may serve as valuable longitudinal biomarkers for ongoing risk stratification.

10.1097/ICL.0000000000001214	Comparison of the Corneal High-Order Aberration and Relative Corneal Refractive	Zhang R, Zhou Y, Ou Y, Chin MP, Li J, Jhanji V, Zhang M	PURPOSE: This study compared the myopia control effects of corneal high-order aberrations (CHOA) from two orthokeratology (OK) lenses based on their relative corneal refractive power shifts. METHODS: In this prospective cohort study, 101 school children with low to moderate myopia were divided into three groups: group A (N=35) used 3-curve design lenses, group B (N=31) used 4-curve design lenses, and group C (N=35) wore regular spectacles. Cycloplegic refraction, visual acuity, and axial length (AL) were measured at baseline and after one year. Keratometry and CHOA were assessed before and after 3 months of lens wear. Relative corneal refractive power shifts and summed corneal power change (SCPC) were calculated. One-way ANOVA and planned comparison analyzed group differences. RESULTS: Group B showed significantly slower AL elongation than group A (P=0.017) after OK treatment. Group B's SCPC was significantly higher than group A's (P≤0.005). Group B had a significant increase in horizontal coma (P=0.004). Increased SCPC led to more coma aberration with four-curve lens wear (P<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The four-curve lens design was more effective in slowing AL elongation for OK treatment. It also caused significantly higher horizontal coma aberration than the three-curve design.

10.1016/j.tem.2025.09.004	Mechanisms and therapeutic insights into MASH-associated fibrosis.	Zhu Y, Cai B	Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) is a progressive liver disease posing a major global health concern, closely related to the rising prevalence of obesity. Liver fibrosis is the primary determinant of adverse outcomes in MASH. The increasing worldwide prevalence, economic impact, and adverse outcomes of MASH-associated fibrosis have spurred extensive research to elucidate its pathogenesis and to address its treatment. However, the intricate mechanism driving the transition from metabolic dysfunction to clinically significant fibrosis is not fully understood. Moreover, effective therapies, particularly direct antifibrotic agents, are still lacking, despite the recent approval of resmetirom and semaglutide for MASH-associated fibrosis. Here, we review current insights into the mechanism of MASH-associated fibrosis and provide a comprehensive overview of emerging therapeutic strategies.

Gillmore JD, Gane E, Täubel J, Pilebro B, Echaniz-Laguna A, Kao J, Litchy W, Shahda S, Haagensen A, Walsh L, Smith D, Kachadourian J, Ward JH, Lebwohl D, Zhu P, Xu Y, Leung A, Sonderfan A, Gutstein DE, Manvelian G, Adams D	BACKGROUND: Hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis with polyneuropathy (ATTRv-PN) is a rare, multisystem, progressive, debilitating, and fatal disease characterized by tissue deposition of misfolded transthyretin (TTR) in peripheral nerves. Nexiguran ziclumeran (nex-z) is an investigational in vivo therapy based on CRISPR-Cas9 (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats and associated Cas9 endonuclease) that is designed to reduce serum TTR levels through selective inactivation of TTR in the liver. METHODS: In this phase 1, open-label study, we administered one infusion of nex-z to patients with ATTRv-PN. Primary objectives included assessment of the safety and pharmacodynamics of nex-z. Secondary end points included changes in the familial amyloid polyneuropathy stage, polyneuropathy disability score, serum neurofilament light chain (NfL) level, modified body-mass index (modified BMI, defined as the conventional BMI [weight in kilograms divided by square of height in meters] multiplied by the albumin level in grams per liter), and modified Neuropathy Impairment Score+7 (mNIS+7; range, 0 to 304, with higher scores indicating more impairment). RESULTS: A total of 36 patients received nex-z; the mean follow-up was 27 months. The mean percent change from baseline in the serum TTR level was -90% at day 28, which was sustained through month 24 (-92%). Treatment-related adverse events included transient infusion-related reactions (in 21 patients), decreased thyroxine level without hypothyroidism or elevated thyrotropin level (in 8), and headache (in 4). One participant died from cardiac amyloidosis, and one withdrew owing to progressive decline in motor function. Serious adverse events were reported in 11 patients. At month 24, the familial amyloid polyneuropathy stage and polyneuropathy disability score remained stable in 29 and 27 patients, respectively; improved in 2 and 5, respectively; and worsened in 2 and 2, respectively. The mean change in the serum NfL level was -9.0 pg per milliliter, and the change in the modified BMI was 24.7. The mean change from baseline in the mNIS+7 was -8.5. CONCLUSIONS: A single administration of nex-z in patients with ATTRv-PN was associated with rapid, deep, and durable reductions in serum TTR levels. The results support further investigation of nex-z to treat ATTRv-PN. (Funded by Intellia Therapeutics and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT04601051.).

10.1001/jamainternmed.2025.4917	The Rise in Early-Onset Cancer in the US Population-More Apparent Than Real.	Patel VR, Adamson AS, Welch HG	IMPORTANCE: Rising rates of early-onset cancer have generated substantial media coverage and public concern. In response, early-onset cancer has become a federal research priority, and clinical guidelines have shifted to recommend earlier screening for some cancers. Yet, it remains unclear whether rising rates represent a true increase in cancer occurrence or that these may instead be explained by increased diagnostic scrutiny. OBSERVATIONS: In aggregate, the 8 cancers with the fastest-rising incidence (>1% per year) in US adults younger than 50 years (thyroid, anus, kidney, small intestine, colorectum, endometrium, pancreas, and myeloma) have doubled in incidence since 1992, while the aggregate mortality for these cancers has remained flat. Colorectal and endometrial cancer showed a slight rise in mortality; for the others, stable or declining mortality alongside rising diagnoses suggests that greater detection (rather than more disease) accounts for the trend. In some cancers, such as thyroid and kidney cancer, overdiagnosis is well documented. For others, incidental detection or earlier diagnosis may explain the trends. While not among the fastest growing (0.6% per year), breast cancer remains the most common early-onset cancer, and despite rising diagnoses in women younger than 50 years, mortality has decreased by approximately half. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The rise in early-onset cancer incidence does not consistently signal a rise in the occurrence of clinically meaningful cancer. While some of the increase in early-onset cancer is likely clinically meaningful, it appears small and limited to a few cancer sites. Much of the increase appears to reflect increased diagnostic scrutiny and overdiagnosis. Interpreting rising incidence as an epidemic of disease may lead to unnecessary screening and treatment while also diverting attention from other more pressing health threats in young adults.

10.13201/j.issn.1001-1781.2018.04.006	[Therapeutic effects of psychological intervention combined with manual reduction	Wang X, Tian YJ, Shan J	Objective:To explore the best treatment for elderly patients with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). Method:Sixty-eight BPPV patients aged 60-85 years were randomly divided into two groups. The control group was treated by simple manipulation. The study group was treated by manual reduction combined with psychological intervention. The curative effect was compared. Result:The cure rates of the control group and the study group were 44.4% and 43.8% respectively, with no significant difference (P>0.05); the effective rates were 52.78% and 87.50% respectively, with significant difference (P<0.05). The recurrence rates of control group and study group were 8.3% and 3.1% after 2 weeks of treatment, respectively, with no significant difference (P>0.05). The recurrence rates at 3 months were 5.6% and 0 respectively, with no significant difference (P>0.05). The difference of SAS and SDS between the two groups after treatment was statistically significant (P<0.05). There was no significant difference in the residual symptoms between the two groups at the first follow-up (P>0.05), and at 1 week and 4 weeks (P<0.05). The residual symptoms of the patients after reoperation were relieved compared with those of the control group. The DHI scores of the study group between 60-70 years old and 71-85 years old group for the first time, after 1 week and 4 weeks were statistically significant (P<0.05), and the residual symptoms in the 60-70 years group were reduced compare to the 71-85-year-old group. Conclusion:Elderly people with BPPV are susceptible to anxiety and depression. Manipulation combined with psychological intervention can promote the curative effect well, but personalized treatment plan should be developed.

10.1007/s00415-025-13374-9	Cognitive stimulation in Parkinson's disease with mild cognitive impairment.	Buonocore J, Iaccino N, Torchia G, Curcio F, Pirrotta FM, Contrada M, Pucci C, Gambardella A, Quattrone A, Pilotto A, Pignolo L, Arabia G	BACKGROUND: Cognitive impairment is among the most frequent and disabling non-motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD), often emerging early and substantially impacting autonomy and quality of life. While cognitive stimulation (CS) is supported in other neurodegenerative conditions, its role in PD is less explored. This study aimed to compare the efficacy of a therapist-guided, home-based CS program, delivered via a virtual reality rehabilitation system, with a conventional in-person CS intervention. METHODS: Of 123 individuals screened, 45 patients with PD and mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI) were randomized to either the tele-rehabilitation group (TRG; n = 25) or the control group (CG; n = 20). Both groups received the same standardized 4-week CS program (20 multi-domain sessions, 5 days/week), targeting memory, attention, executive functions, language, and visuospatial skills. The TRG trained at home via the VRRS platform under remote supervision, while the CG attended outpatient sessions. Neuropsychological and clinical outcomes were assessed at baseline (T1), post-intervention (T2), and 6-month follow-up (T3). Analyses included repeated-measures ANOVA, multivariate linear regression, and categorical comparisons based on predefined clinical cut-offs. RESULTS: All participants completed the intervention with adherence exceeding 90% in both groups. At T2, the TRG showed greater improvements than the CG in global cognition, working memory, and delayed recall. These effects remained significant after adjusting for age, sex, baseline performance, and cognitive reserve index, and were robust to false discovery rate correction. Regression models confirmed these improvements. Categorical analyses also showed a marked reduction in pathological scores in the TRG in the same domains. CONCLUSION: A short-term, therapist-guided CS program delivered via tele-rehabilitation effectively improved cognitive functioning in PD-MCI, with partial benefits maintained at 6 months, especially in memory and executive domains. The intervention was particularly beneficial for memory and executive functions, highlighting telemedicine as a promising and accessible option for cognitive care in PD.

METHODS: We systematically searched MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane Library for randomized controlled trials comparing once-weekly tirzepatide (5-15 mg) versus placebo in adults with or without diabetes for at least 26 weeks. For each subpopulation analysis, the random-effects model was used to calculate pooled risk ratios (RRs) and mean differences (MDs), with their 95% confidence intervals, for dichotomous and continuous endpoints, respectively. Statistical significance was considered at p < 0.05. RESULTS: We included five trials (n = 2,174) in patients with diabetes (BMI ≥ 23 kg/m(2)) and five (n = 4,467) in patients without diabetes (BMI ≥ 27 [≥24 in Asia] kg/m(2)). Compared with placebo, tirzepatide led to significantly greater relative and absolute weight reductions in patients with (RR -9.54%, p < 0.01; MD -9.06 kg, p < 0.01) and without diabetes (RR -17.15%, p < 0.01; MD -18.11 kg, p < 0.01). In both subpopulations, tirzepatide also significantly increased the probability of achieving weight reductions of ≥5%, ≥10%, and ≥15%, as well as improved BMI, waist circumference, blood pressure, hemoglobin A1c, and lipid levels. Notably, weight-related benefits with tirzepatide were significantly greater in patients without diabetes, whereas its safety was similar across subpopulations and predominantly consisted of mild to moderate, well-tolerated adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with placebo, tirzepatide resulted in statistically significant and clinically meaningful weight reduction, especially in patients without diabetes (with overweight/obesity), with an acceptable safety profile.

10.1111/acel.70233	Age-Associated Transcriptomic and Epigenetic Alterations in Mouse Hippocampus.	Bilgic M, Obata R, Panfil VI, Zhu Z, Saeki M, Gotoh Y, Kishi Y	Aging represents a major risk for human neurodegenerative disorders, such as dementia and Alzheimer's disease, and is associated with a functional decline in neurons and impaired synaptic plasticity, leading to a gradual decline in memory. Previous research has identified molecular and functional changes associated with aging through transcriptomic studies and neuronal excitability measurements, while the role of chromatin-level regulation in vulnerability to aging-related diseases is not well understood. Moreover, the causal relationship between molecular alterations and aging-associated decline in functions of different cell types remains poorly understood. Here, we systematically characterized gene regulatory networks in a cell type-specific manner in the aging mouse hippocampus, a central brain region involved in learning and memory formation, by simultaneously profiling gene expression and chromatin accessibility at a single-nucleus level. The analysis of multiome (RNA and ATAC) sequencing recapitulated the diversity of glial and neuronal cell types in the hippocampus and revealed transcriptomic and chromatin accessibility level changes in different cell types, among which oligodendrocytes and dentate gyrus (DG) neurons exhibited the most drastic changes. We found pronounced aging-dependent chromatin-level changes among neurons, especially for genes related to synaptic plasticity. Our data suggest that BACH2, a candidate transcription factor implicated in aging-mediated functional decline of DG neurons, potentially regulates genes associated with synaptic plasticity, cell death, and inflammation during aging. Taken together, our single-nucleus multiome analysis reveals potential cell type-specific regulators involved in the aging of neurons and glial cells.	Aging cell	28/09/2025

10.1186/s12933-025-02921-3	Association of the triglyceride-glucose index combined with a body shape index	Chen M, Guo J, Shangguan Y, Sun Z, He X, Tu Q, Yan Q	BACKGROUND: The triglyceride-glucose (TyG) index, as a measure of insulin resistance, has been confirmed to be associated with adverse clinical outcomes. The new composite indicator, TyG-A body type index (TyG-ABSI), by integrating the TyG index and the A body type index, has demonstrated superior efficacy in predicting the risk of cardiovascular death in the general population compared to traditional indicators. This study aims to deeply explore the association between TyG-ABSI and all-cause mortality and CVD mortality in the population with cardiovascular kidney-metabolic syndrome (CKM) stages 0-3. The analysis will be conducted from multiple dimensions such as the intensity of indicator correlation and potential influencing mechanisms, in order to comprehensively reveal the relationship between the two. RESULTS: We analyzed data from 13,480 participants in the NHANES cohort (1999-2018) using Cox proportional hazards models and restricted cubic spline functions. The results indicated that elevated TyG-ABSI values were independently associated with a higher risk of all-cause mortality (HR = 1.226, 95% CI 1.104-1.361) and cardiovascular mortality (HR = 1.377, 95% CI 1.149-1.651). Time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and concordance index evaluations demonstrated that TyG-ABSI yielded more accurate long-term prognostic performance than other TyG-derived metrics. The area under the curve (AUC) of this indicator reached 0.688-0.708 in the prediction of all-cause mortality risk over 5-15 years, and 0.696-0.739 in the prediction of cardiovascular mortality risk. External validation using CHARLS data confirmed the robustness of these findings in predicting all-cause mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Among individuals with CKM stages 0-3, TyG-ABSI demonstrates a stronger association with mortality risk and superior predictive ability compared with other TyG-derived metrics. Its performance suggests a potential role in capturing variations across diverse clinical subgroups, and informing optimal timing for preventive interventions.	Cardiovascular diabetology	23/09/2025

Early colon cancer detection in patient populations ineligible for testing, such as the elderly or those with significant comorbidities, could have clinical benefit. Despite many attempts to identify individual protein markers of this disease, little progress has been made. Targeted mass spectrometry, using multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) technology, enables the simultaneous assessment of groups of candidates for improved detection performance. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A multiplex assay was developed for 187 candidate marker proteins, using 337 peptides monitored through 674 simultaneously measured MRM transitions in a 30-minute liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of immunodepleted blood plasma. To evaluate the combined candidate marker performance, the present study used 274 individual patient blood plasma samples, 137 with biopsy-confirmed colorectal cancer and 137 age- and gender-matched controls. Using 2 well-matched platforms running 5 days each week, all 274 samples were analyzed in 52 days. RESULTS: Using one half of the data as a discovery set (69 disease cases and 69 control cases), the elastic net feature selection and random forest classifier assembly were used in cross-validation to identify a 15-transition classifier. The mean training receiver operating characteristic area under the curve was 0.82. After final classifier assembly using the entire discovery set, the 136-sample (68 disease cases and 68 control cases) validation set was evaluated. The validation area under the curve was 0.91. At the point of maximum accuracy (84%), the sensitivity was 87% and the specificity was 81%. CONCLUSION: These results have demonstrated the ability of simultaneous assessment of candidate marker proteins using high-multiplex, targeted-mass spectrometry to identify a subset group of CRC markers with significant and meaningful performance.

10.3881/j.issn.1000-503X.2014.01.021	[Roles of microRNAs in allergic airway diseases].	Teng YS, Cao XL, Li Y	The microRNAs (miRNAs/miRs) are a class of short non-coding RNAs regulating protein translation via mRNAs silencing. Studies have shown that microRNAs play critical roles in allergic diseases, tumors, and infections. The allergic airway diseases are characterized by inflammation and hyperresponsiveness of the respiratory tract. Several miRNAs are found to be involved in a series of pathophysiologic processes in allergic airway diseases including inflammatory cells infiltration, cytokines' expressions, airway hyperresponsiveness, and proliferation and change in phenotype of smooth muscle cells. Therefore, miRNAs may be new therapeutic targets for these allgeric diseases. This article reviews the roles of miRNAs in asthma and allergic rhinitis and their molecular biological mechanisms.

The new 2024 McDonald criteria provide a unified approach for diagnosing multiple sclerosis in individuals with relapsing or progressive courses throughout the lifespan (ie, from paediatric to late-life presentations). The optic nerve can now serve as a fifth anatomical location within the CNS for diagnosis. The central vein sign, paramagnetic rim lesions, and kappa free-light chain concentrations in CSF can be used, when available, to provide supportive evidence and confer specificity for a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis in specific situations. In certain cases, radiologically isolated syndrome or neurological symptoms that do not constitute a clear attack or progression of disability can fulfil the criteria for a multiple sclerosis diagnosis. We also provide guidance for the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis in older individuals (≥50 years) and those with comorbidities. The 2024 revised criteria should expedite the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis, while maintaining specificity.	The Lancet. Neurology	01/10/2025
10.1186/s12984-025-01738-1	Effects of intermittent theta-burst stimulation on cognition and glymphatic	Yang CC, Huang KY, Hsu JL, Hu CJ, Lu YH, Kuan YC	BACKGROUND: Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has demonstrated efficacy in alleviating cognitive symptoms in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Although animal studies suggest rTMS may enhance glymphatic system efficiency and reduce amyloid deposits, its impact on human glymphatic activity remains uncertain. METHODS: This double-blind, randomized, sham-controlled trial investigated the effects of intermittent theta-burst stimulation (iTBS), a novel rTMS technique, on cognitive function and glymphatic system activity using diffusion tensor image analysis along the perivascular space (DTI-ALPS) in 52 participants with amnestic MCI or very mild AD. Participants underwent 10 sessions of iTBS targeting the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex over two weeks. Cognitive and glymphatic assessments were conducted at baseline, week 2, and week 6. Of the 52 participants, 28 received active iTBS, while 24 received sham stimulation. After the first two weeks, the sham group transitioned to active iTBS. RESULTS: Significant cognitive improvements were observed at week 6 in the iTBS group, indicating delayed cognitive enhancement, though no immediate changes in cognition or glymphatic system activity (measured by the ALPS index) were observed. No adverse events were reported. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that iTBS can produce delayed cognitive enhancement in individuals with amnestic MCI and very mild AD, while the impact on the glymphatic system remains uncertain and requires further investigation.

10.3390/ijms21030969	Precision Psychiatry Applications with Pharmacogenomics: Artificial Intelligence	Lin E, Lin CH, Lane HY	A growing body of evidence now suggests that precision psychiatry, an interdisciplinary field of psychiatry, precision medicine, and pharmacogenomics, serves as an indispensable foundation of medical practices by offering the accurate medication with the accurate dose at the accurate time to patients with psychiatric disorders. In light of the latest advancements in artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques, numerous biomarkers and genetic loci associated with psychiatric diseases and relevant treatments are being discovered in precision psychiatry research by employing neuroimaging and multi-omics. In this review, we focus on the latest developments for precision psychiatry research using artificial intelligence and machine learning approaches, such as deep learning and neural network algorithms, together with multi-omics and neuroimaging data. Firstly, we review precision psychiatry and pharmacogenomics studies that leverage various artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques to assess treatment prediction, prognosis prediction, diagnosis prediction, and the detection of potential biomarkers. In addition, we describe potential biomarkers and genetic loci that have been discovered to be associated with psychiatric diseases and relevant treatments. Moreover, we outline the limitations in regard to the previous precision psychiatry and pharmacogenomics studies. Finally, we present a discussion of directions and challenges for future research.

Current and former smokers are at a high risk for lung cancer and are candidates for prevention and early detection strategies. Sputum is a potential source of biomarkers that might determine either lung cancer risk or the presence of early lung cancer, but no current sputum test is sufficiently sensitive and specific for effective screening. We used fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to measure chromosomal aneusomy (CA) in sputum samples collected prospectively from 100 incident lung cancer cases and 96 controls (matched on age, gender, and date of collection) nested within an ongoing high-risk cohort. The CA-FISH assay was aimed at four DNA targets: epidermal growth factor receptor, MYC, 5p15, and CEP 6. The sensitivity of a positive CA-FISH assay (abnormal for two or more of the four markers) for lung cancer was substantially higher for samples collected within 18 months (76% sensitivity) than for samples collected more than 18 months (31%) before lung cancer diagnosis. Sensitivity was higher for squamous cell cancers (94%) than for other histologic types (69%).	Cancer prevention research (Philadelphia, Pa.)	01/04/2010

The evolving epidemiology and complex pathophysiology of MetALD present unique challenges and opportunities for clinical trial design. Inclusion criteria should require simultaneous evidence of metabolic dysfunction (at least two cardiometabolic features) and verified quantifiable alcohol exposure recorded over the preceding 3-6 months. Traditional histological end points are limited by invasiveness, sampling error and interpretative variability. Thus, imaging modalities, serum-based fibrosis biomarkers and quantitative measures of alcohol intake are gaining relevance as non-invasive, reproducible and patient-centric end points aiming to improve trial feasibility. Furthermore, incorporating alcohol biomarkers, stratifying patients by metabolic risk factor burden, and using adaptive designs of trials might enhance the precision and generalizability of MetALD clinical trials. Although uncertainties remain regarding optimal patient selection criteria, event rates and the dynamic interplay between metabolic dysfunction and alcohol intake, ongoing research efforts aim to refine diagnostic criteria, standardize methodologies and validate novel end points. These advances will ultimately accelerate drug development, improve trial efficiency and foster interventions to treat MetALD.	Nature reviews. Gastroenterology & hepatology	26/09/2025

Purpose: to evaluate the prevalence and location of assaults against nursing personnel in Latin America, and to determine predictor factors for aggression against nurses. (2) Methods: A cross-sectional online survey was answered by 374 nurses working in health care during the COVID-19 pandemic. The aggression against nurses was estimated using the Victimization Scale. (3) Results: A total of 288 nurses were included in this study. The victimization scale showed that 52.1% of nurses have suffered aggression by the general population during the COVID-19 pandemic. Males were more likely to be attacked than females (p < 0.05). Additionally, males were attacked more frequently on public transport (x(2) = 6.72, p = 0.01). The home neighborhood and markets were other locations with a higher risk of being assaulted (OR: 3.39, CI: 1.53-7.50). (4) Conclusions: Our results indicate that nurses in Latin America who work during the COVID-19 pandemic and social isolation have been frequently assaulted by the general public. Males are more frequently attacked than females and the main places of aggression are public transportation, their home neighborhood and supermarkets. Implications for nursing practice: it is necessary to create and implement protocols and guidelines to support nursing personnel during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study was retrospectively registered at the Juarez Autonomous University of Tabasco (103/CIPDACS/2020) on the (08/2020).	Nursing reports (Pavia, Italy)	7/10/2023

Originally classified into 3 groups, the number of contributing genes is still increasing, underlining the need for a deeper understanding of the molecular interaction during intrahepatic cholestasis. METHODS: In the present study, we investigate the interplay of heterozygous variants in 3 cholestasis-associated genes (ABCB11, ABCB4, and MYO5B) by exploiting iPSC-based hepatic organoids from a patient suffering from recurrent intrahepatic cholestasis. RESULTS: Functional characterization of MRP2-mediated cholyl-lysyl-fluorescein (CLF) and BSEP-mediated Tauro-nor-THCA-24-DBD transport demonstrated a marked reduction of transport in MYO5B-deficient organoids, in comparison to unaffected control organoids. Moreover, iPSC-based organoids derived from the patient carrying 3 heterozygous variants in ABCB11, ABCB4, and MYO5B also exhibited absence of BSEP-mediated Tauro-nor-THCA-24-DBD transport, but functional MRP2-mediated CLF-transport. Interestingly, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated correction of the mutated ABCB11 allele could not restore the impaired BSEP function, suggesting the heterozygous MYO5B variant as the main driver of the transport deficiency. In fact, CRISPR/Cas-mediated correction of the MYO5B variant finally resulted in a restoration of the BSEP-mediated Tauro-nor-THCA-24-DBD transport. CONCLUSIONS: iPSC-based organoids serve as an authentic model for functional assessment of the hepatobiliary transport with fluorescent substrates. This allows the characterization of variants of uncertain significance and other variants in cholestasis-associated genes and revealed that a heterozygous MYO5B variant increases the susceptibility to defective hepatobiliary BSEP-mediated transport.

10.1007/s10495-025-02190-1	Integrating pathology genomics and single-cell genomics to identify lactate	Zhao S, Liang X, Xie J, Lin Z, Li Z, Jiang Z, Chen W, Dai H, He Y, Li L	Cutaneous melanoma (SKCM) is highly malignant and prone to developing treatment resistance. Lactate metabolism in the tumor microenvironment (TME) plays a crucial role in SKCM progression, immune evasion, and therapy resistance. This study aimed to integrate multi-omics data to systematically characterize the molecular features of lactate metabolism in SKCM, construct an effective prognostic model, and explore potential therapeutic strategies. Quantitative pathological features were extracted using CellProfiler and combined with deep learning features obtained from a pre-trained ResNet50 convolutional neural network. Gene set variation analysis (GSVA) was used to calculate lactate metabolism scores and identify associated pathological features. Single-cell RNA sequencing was applied to assess lactate metabolic activity across different cell types. These data, together with spatial transcriptomics, genomic alterations, immune infiltration profiles, and immunotherapy response data, were integrated to construct a lactate metabolism signature (LMS) prognostic model (comprising 3 pathological features and 11 genes). The model was developed using 101 combinations of 10 machine learning algorithms. Furthermore, RAB32 knockdown experiments were performed to verify its effects on melanoma cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and metabolism. A total of 443 pathological imaging features significantly associated with lactate metabolism were identified. Single-cell analysis revealed that melanoma cells exhibited the highest lactate metabolic activity, with markedly enhanced intercellular communication in the high-metabolism group. The LMS model demonstrated excellent prognostic performance in both the TCGA training and validation cohorts. Patients in the high-LMS group had significantly shorter survival, showed immune evasion features, and exhibited activation of melanoma-related metabolic and signaling pathways (e.g., oxidative phosphorylation). In contrast, the low-LMS group had stronger immune infiltration and higher expression of immune checkpoint molecules. The key gene RAB32 was significantly correlated with all lactate metabolism-related pathological features, was highly expressed in the tumor core, and its high expression predicted poor prognosis. RAB32 knockdown markedly inhibited melanoma cell proliferation, migration, and invasion; reduced lactate production; suppressed the expression of glycolytic enzymes and lactate transporters; and decreased extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) and oxygen consumption rate (OCR). In addition, it significantly inhibited tumor growth in mouse xenograft models. This study developed a multi-omics-integrated prognostic model (LMS) based on lactate metabolism, providing a novel tool for risk stratification and therapeutic decision-making in SKCM patients. It also identified RAB32 as a central player in tumor metabolic reprogramming and invasiveness, with promising potential as a therapeutic target.

We enrolled 84 eligible patients with uncontrolled CRSwNP and stratified them based on baseline tissue eosinophil count. Patients are assigned to receive CM326 220 mg (n = 40) or placebo (n = 20) every 2 weeks (Q2W) and CM326 220 mg (n = 20) or placebo (n = 4) every 4 weeks (Q4W) for 16 weeks. Subsequently, all patients continue on CM326 220 mg Q2W or Q4W for an additional 36 weeks, followed by a 12-week follow up. Primary endpoints are safety of CM326 and change from baseline in NPS at week 16 in patients with eosinophilic CRSwNP (ECRSwNP). Main secondary endpoints include the change from baseline in NPS at week 16 in non-eosinophilic CRSwNP (nonECRwNP) and pharmacodynamic markers. Throughout the 64-week study, all treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) are mild or moderate. CM326 Q2W improves NPS in patients with ECRSwNP compared with placebo at week 16 (mean difference [95% CI], -1.2 [-2.3 to -0.1], P = 0.04), with sustained benefits during the open-label and follow-up periods. Notably, peripheral blood and tissue eosinophil counts and concentrations of plasma IL-13 and IL-5 are reduced by week 16 with the treatment of CM326 Q2W versus placebo. A post-hoc analysis demonstrates that all participants with baseline TSLP > 330 fg/mL achieve a substantial reduction in NPS by week 16 with the treatment of CM326 Q2W (mean difference vs. placebo: -1.75 [95%CI, -3.06 to -0.44], P = 0.01). Overall, CM326 is well tolerated and effective in patients with uncontrolled ECRSwNP. A baseline plasma TSLP level of 330 fg/mL may serve as a predictive marker for treatment efficacy of CM326.

10.1038/s41598-021-98584-7	Large-bodied birds are over-represented in unstructured citizen science data.	Callaghan CT, Poore AGB, Hofmann M, Roberts CJ, Pereira HM	Citizen science platforms are quickly accumulating hundreds of millions of biodiversity observations around the world annually. Quantifying and correcting for the biases in citizen science datasets remains an important first step before these data are used to address ecological questions and monitor biodiversity. One source of potential bias among datasets is the difference between those citizen science programs that have unstructured protocols and those that have semi-structured or structured protocols for submitting observations. To quantify biases in an unstructured citizen science platform, we contrasted bird observations from the unstructured iNaturalist platform with that from a semi-structured citizen science platform-eBird-for the continental United States. We tested whether four traits of species (body size, commonness, flock size, and color) predicted if a species was under- or over-represented in the unstructured dataset compared with the semi-structured dataset. We found strong evidence that large-bodied birds were over-represented in the unstructured citizen science dataset; moderate evidence that common species were over-represented in the unstructured dataset; strong evidence that species in large groups were over-represented; and no evidence that colorful species were over-represented in unstructured citizen science data. Our results suggest that biases exist in unstructured citizen science data when compared with semi-structured data, likely as a result of the detectability of a species and the inherent recording process. Importantly, in programs like iNaturalist the detectability process is two-fold-first, an individual organism needs to be detected, and second, it needs to be photographed, which is likely easier for many large-bodied species. Our results indicate that caution is warranted when using unstructured citizen science data in ecological modelling, and highlight body size as a fundamental trait that can be used as a covariate for modelling opportunistic species occurrence records, representing the detectability or identifiability in unstructured citizen science datasets. Future research in this space should continue to focus on quantifying and documenting biases in citizen science data, and expand our research by including structured citizen science data to understand how biases differ among unstructured, semi-structured, and structured citizen science platforms.

Here we develop a NLPHL specific lymphocyte-predominant ecotype (LPE) model to identify 34 distinct cell states across 14 cell types that co-occur within 3 LPEs for 171 cases. LPE1 and LPE2 were characterized by immunosuppressive microenvironments with high expression of B2M on LP cells, CD8 T-cell exhaustion, immune checkpoint genes expressed by follicular T-cells, and an improved freedom from progression compared to LPE3 in training (n = 109, with 65% LPE1/2) and validation cohorts (n = 62, with 61% LPE1/2). We validate the co-occurrence and co-localization of cell states using spatial transcriptomics. Protein expression of HLA-I and HLA-II on LP cells and SSTR2 on dendritic cells was predictive of LPE1 (C-statistic=0.69), LPE2 (C-statistic=0.79), and LPE3 (C-statistic=0.60).

10.1038/s12276-025-01534-w	Cholesterol-driven pathological astrocytic responses in diabetes-associated	Niu T, Wang S, Zhang H, Zhu W, Liu K, Zhou X, Sun R, Niu D, Yuan Y	The diabetic environment, characterized by hyperglycemia, advanced glycation end products and cerebral insulin resistance, triggers pathological astrocytic responses that contribute to cognitive decline in diabetes-associated cognitive impairment. Cholesterol accumulation in the brain, particularly in astrocytes, contributes to this pathological process. SCAP, a cholesterol sensor involved in lipid imbalances, regulates metabolic diseases, but its role in astrocytes remains unclear. C57BL/6J wild-type and astrocyte-specific SCAP knockout mice were fed a high-fat diet and treated with streptozotocin to induce type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Behavioral tests and hippocampal histology were performed at 28 weeks. We investigated the NF-κB-C3 signaling pathway to elucidate how SCAP induces pathological astrocytic responses under diabetic conditions. Cognitive function was assessed in patients with T2DM using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and the mini-mental state examination (MMSE). We found elevated SCAP expression in the astrocytes of T2DM mice, correlated with cognitive dysfunction, impaired synaptic plasticity and altered astrocyte morphology. These effects were mitigated in astrocyte-specific SCAP knockout mice. SCAP elevation activates NF-κB by recruiting IκBα to the Golgi apparatus, promoting C3 transcription. Conversely, the inhibition of SCAP suppressed NF-κB activation. In patients with T2DM, serum C3 levels were higher in those with mild cognitive impairment, showing a U-shaped correlation with low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) levels. These findings uncover a critical regulatory axis underlying astrocytic dysfunction, where SCAP mediates pathological astrocytic responses via the NF-κB-C3 pathway, with the Golgi acting as the platform for SCAP-driven activation. Here we highlight the interaction between cholesterol disorders and pathological astrocytic responses, presenting SCAP as a potential target for therapeutic intervention in diabetes-associated cognitive impairment. Research Hypothesis Illustration: SCAP and complement C3 play a role in cholesterol-driven astrocyte responses in diabetes-associated cognitive impairment. Astrocytic SCAP expression is abnormally increased in HFD/STZ-induced diabetic mice, impairing neuronal synaptic plasticity by activating the IκBα/NF-κB/C3 signalling pathway. Upregulated SCAP in astrocytes directly binds to IκBα, increasing its activation in the Golgi apparatus, which promotes NF-κB nuclear translocation and triggers complement C3 transcriptional activation and inflammatory immune responses, ultimately leading to neuronal and cognitive damage.

Using single-cell RNA sequencing, flow cytometry, and immunofluorescence, we found that thymus-derived Treg cells infiltrate the injured spinal cord via peripheral blood around 3 days post-SCI. Treg cell depletion worsened SCI and impaired long-term recovery. Transcriptomic profiling revealed strong anti-inflammatory functions of Treg cells and the potential to regulate cholesterol metabolism in neighboring microglia. Further single-cell RNA sequencing uncovered the clonality of SCI-associated Treg cells. Major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC II) expression on microglia, not macrophages, was crucial for sustaining Treg cell numbers and neuroprotective function, with myelin-phagocytosing microglia-activated Treg cells showing significant neuroprotective effects. Treg cells mitigated microglial inflammation via CTLA-4 and upregulated the ATP-binding cassette transporter G1 (Abcg1) receptor in microglia, helping to manage myelin load and reduce lipid droplet formation. Our findings offer mechanistic insights into SCI-associated Treg cells and lay the groundwork for future Treg-based therapies in SCI treatment.	Neuron	29/09/2025
10.1038/s41591-025-03977-0	Full-spectrum extract from Cannabis sativa DKJ127 for chronic low back pain: a	Karst M, Meissner W, Sator S, Keßler J, Schoder V, Häuser W	Chronic low back pain (CLBP) affects over half a billion people worldwide. Current pharmacologic treatments offer limited efficacy and carry substantial risks, warranting the development of safe and effective alternatives. This multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of VER-01 in CLBP. It enrolled 820 adults with CLBP (VER-01, n = 394; placebo, n = 426) and included a double-blind 12-week treatment phase (phase A), a 6-month open-label extension (phase B), followed by either a 6-month continuation (phase C) or randomized withdrawal (phase D). The primary endpoint of phase A was a change in mean numeric rating scale (NRS) pain intensity, with a change in total neuropathic pain symptom inventory (NPSI) score as a key secondary endpoint in participants with a neuropathic pain component (PainDETECT > 18). The primary endpoint for phase D was time to treatment failure. The study met its primary endpoint in phase A, with a mean pain reduction of -1.9 NRS points in the VER-01 group (mean difference (MD) versus placebo = -0.6, 95% confidence interval (CI) = -0.9 to -0.3; P < 0.001). Pain further decreased to -2.9 NRS points in phase B, with effects sustained through phase C. The study also met its key secondary endpoint of phase A, with a mean NPSI decrease of -14.4 (standard error, 3.3) points from baseline in the VER-01 arm (MD versus placebo = -7.3, 95% CI = -13.2 to -1.3; P = 0.017). Although phase D did not meet its primary endpoint (hazard ratio = 0.75, 95% CI = 0.44-1.27; P = 0.288), pain increased significantly more with placebo upon withdrawal (MD = 0.5, 95% CI = 0.0-1.0; P = 0.034). In phase A, the incidence of adverse events-mostly mild to moderate and transient-was higher with VER-01 than with placebo (83.3% versus 67.3%; P < 0.001). VER-01 was well-tolerated, with no signs of dependence or withdrawal. VER-01 shows potential as a new, safe and effective treatment for CLBP. ClinicalTrials.gov registration: NCT04940741 .

10.1080/02640414.2016.1171890	"New insights in professional horse racing; ""in-race"" heart rate data, elevated"	O'Reilly J, Cheng HL, Poon ET	"Weight-making practices have been shown to impair musculoskeletal and physiological function of jockeys. This study investigated the ""in-race"" heart rate (HR) responses and hydration status during competitive racing, as well as selected physiological and lifestyle parameters of professional jockeys based in Hong Kong. ""In-race"" HR responses and early morning hydration status of 20 male jockeys were examined in hot and moderate climactic occasions. Additionally, bone mineral density (BMD), dietary intake and lifestyle choices were assessed. Osteopenia was observed in the calcanei of jockeys (left: 0.51 ± 0.06; right: 0.46 ± 0.12 g · cm(-2)). Energy and protein intake were significantly lower on a race day compared to a non-race day (P < 0.05). ""In-race"" HR(max) values were similar to those from VO(2max) laboratory tests (186 ± 14 vs. 185 ± 8 bpm). Hypohydration was observed on both racing days.

10.1038/s41467-025-63338-w	CD137L promotes immune surveillance in melanoma via HLTF regulation.	Liang L, Zhu L, Li X, Zhou W, Zhang Y, Hung MC, Zhang G, Chen Y, Kuang X, Su J, Liu J, Chen X, Liu H	Immune checkpoint blockers (ICBs) have demonstrated substantial efficacy across various malignancies, yet the benefits of ICBs are limited to a subset of patients. Therefore, it is essential to identify novel therapeutic targets. By integrating multi-omics data from cohorts of patients with melanoma treated with ICBs, a positive correlation is observed between tumor CD137L expression and the efficacy of PD-1 blockade. Functionally, CD137L induction in cancer cells significantly enhances anti-tumor immunity by promoting CD8(+) T cell survival, both in vivo and in vitro. Mechanistically, helicase-like transcription factor (HLTF) is identified as a pivotal transcriptional regulator of CD137L, controlling its expression through phosphorylation of serine at position 398. Therapeutically, the AMPK agonist AICAR (acadesine) as an inducer of CD137L, exhibiting synergistic effects with PD-1 or CTLA-4 blockade. In summary, our findings elucidate a mechanism controlling CD137L expression and highlight a promising combination therapy to enhance the efficacy of ICBs in melanoma. One Sentence Summary: Inducing co-stimulatory immune checkpoint CD137L expression in melanoma cells enhances T cell-mediated anti-tumor immunity.	Nature communications	26/09/2025
10.1002/alz.70726	Alzheimer's disease diagnostic progression is associated with cerebrovascular	Edwards NC, Lao PJ, Alshikho MJ, Ericsson OM, Rizvi B, Petersen ME, O'Bryant S, Flores-Aguilar L, Simoes S, Mapstone M, Tudorascu DL, Janelidze S, Hansson O, Handen BL, Christian BT, Lee JH, Lai F, Rosas HD, Zaman S, Lott IT, Yassa MA, Gutierrez J, Wilcock DM, Head E, Brickman AM	INTRODUCTION: Despite having few vascular risk factors, people with Down syndrome (DS) have MRI evidence of cerebrovascular disease (CVD) and neuroinflammation that worsens with Alzheimer's disease (AD) severity. We investigated whether markers of CVD and inflammation are associated with AD-related diagnostic progression in people with DS. METHODS: We included 149 participants (mean age [SD] = 44.6 [9]) from the Alzheimer's Biomarkers Consortium-Down Syndrome who had two (n = 24) or three follow-up visits (n = 125). We derived white matter hyperintensity (WMH) volume and plasma biomarker (glial fibrillary acidic protein [GFAP], amyloid beta [Aβ]42/Aβ40, hyperphosphorylated tau-217 [p-tau217], and neurofilament light [NfL]) concentrations at baseline and examined their association with progression in clinical diagnosis. RESULTS: Higher baseline WMH volume and higher GFAP were associated with a greater likelihood of diagnostic progression. Combining WMH and GFAP with p-tau217 improved clinical conversion classification accuracy over AD biomarkers alone. Among individuals with evidence of amyloidosis, both WMH and GFAP were associated with clinical progression. DISCUSSION: In DS, markers of CVD and inflammation are independently and synergistically associated with clinical AD progression. HIGHLIGHTS: Higher baseline white matter hyperintensity (WMH) volume and plasma glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) concentration were associated with a higher likelihood of progressing from cognitively stable to either mild cognitive impairment or clinical Alzheimer's disease in Down syndrome. WMH volume and GFAP concentration discriminated between those who progressed and those who did not. Models including the independent and interactive effects of WMH and GFAP more accurately discriminated between participants who progressed diagnostically from those who did not. Individuals with evidence of amyloid pathology were more likely to progress if they also had elevated WMH or GFAP.	Alzheimer's & dementia : the journal of the Alzheimer's Association	01/10/2025
10.1016/j.heares.2011.01.015	Roles of prostaglandin E2 in the cochlea.	Nakagawa T	Prostaglandins are one of the major groups of chemical mediators in the mammalian body. Among prostaglandins, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) is the most abundant prostanoid in humans and involved in regulating many different fundamental biological functions. PGE2 signaling is mediated by four distinct E-prostanoid receptors (EPs) namely EP1-4. Recently, accumulating evidence indicates critical, but complex roles of EP signaling in the pathogenesis of neuronal diseases depending on the context of neuronal injury. Four distinct EPs are expressed in the stria vascularis, spiral ligament, spiral ganglion and organ of Corti, indicating an involvement of EP signaling in the cochlear function. Activation of EP4 in cochleae significantly attenuates noise-induced damage in cochleae, and activation of EP2 or EP4 induces the formation of vascular endothelial growth factor in cochleae. These findings strongly suggest that individual EP signaling may be involved in the maintenance of the cochlear sensory system similarly to the central nervous system. This review highlights recent findings on EP signaling in the central nervous system, and presents its possible roles in regulation of blood flow, protection of sensory cells and immune responses in cochleae.

10.1038/s41417-025-00967-9	Paricalcitol and hydroxychloroquine modulates extracellular matrix and enhance	Bandi DSR, Sarvesh S, Foote J, Welsch D, Cheng C, Akce M, Nagaraju GP, El-Rayes BF	Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a highly aggressive cancer with poor prognosis and limited therapeutic options. In a previous publication, our group defined some of the mechanisms that vitamin D analogue paricalcitol (P) and hydroxychloroquine (H) potentiated the effects of gemcitabine-based chemotherapy in PDAC. Based on this, we hypothesized that PH may potentiate 5-fluorouracil (5FU) and Oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy, and this may involve a novel mechanism of extracellular matrix (ECM) modulation. The combination of PH with 5FU+Oxaliplatin significantly increased the cell death, apoptosis, and S-phase cell cycle arrest as compared to untreated or 5FU + Oxaliplatin-treated MIA PaCa-2, HPAC and KPC cell lines. In vivo, the combination therapy inhibited PDAC growth and altered the immune landscape by activating T and NK cells. Proteomic analysis revealed significant reduction in ECM proteins, specifically integrin beta-4 (ITGB4). Confirmation of the role of ITGB4 was performed through genetic knockdown of ITGB4, which led ECM inhibition. In conclusion, the combination of PH significantly enhances the efficacy of Oxaliplatin and 5FU. We identified a new mechanism of action of PH through inhibiting ITGB4, leading to ECM modulation. These results suggest that the combination of PH with cytotoxic chemotherapy should be tested in PDAC clinical trials.	Cancer gene therapy	27/09/2025

We examined the contribution of activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4), the central node of the integrated stress response (ISR), to T cell dysfunction in tumors. CD8(+) tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in patient samples exhibited chronic ATF4 activity, which was reflected across various tumor models. Hypoxia in the TME imposed chronic ATF4 activity via the ISR kinases. ATF4 overexpression in CD8(+) T cells induced metabolic polarity, mitochondrial oxidative stress, and cell death, impairing antitumor immunity. Chronic ATF4 transcriptional activity replicated the terminal exhaustion CD8(+) T cell state independent of T cell receptor (TCR) stimulation. Genetic or pharmacologic attenuation of ATF4 reduced mitochondrial oxidative stress and promoted CD8(+) TIL viability, enabling response to programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) inhibitor therapy and conferring protection from re-emergent disease. Thus, the ISR converges on chronic ATF4 activity in CD8(+) TILs as a barrier to ICI response, positioning ISR therapeutics as candidates for immunotherapy.	Immunity	25/09/2025
10.1002/advs.202504138	Adamts1 Exacerbates Post-Myocardial Infarction Scar Formation via Mechanosensing	Kong CY, Guo Z, Ma YL, Wang MY, Ni HY, Wang P, Qiu WJ, Wang EG, Li Z, Yang Z, Shen B, Tang QZ	-Myocardial infarction (MI) remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, with post-infarction cardiac remodeling, particularly excessive scar formation, representing a critical determinant of patient outcomes. However, the mechanistic pathways governing pathological scar formation remain incompletely understood. Here, we demonstrate that ADAMTS1 (A Disintegrin and Metalloproteinase with Thrombospondin Motifs 1), significantly upregulated in endothelial cells (ECs) following MI, plays a pivotal role in regulating cardiac fibroblast activation through a novel mechanotransduction pathway involving integrin α8 (ITGα8). Using EC-specific ADAMTS1 overexpression and knockout mice combined with cardiac fibroblast-specific ITGα8 deletion models, we found that ADAMTS1 overexpression exacerbates cardiac dysfunction and increases scar size, while ADAMTS1 deficiency provides cardioprotection. Mechanistically, ADAMTS1 modulates extracellular matrix stiffness through proteoglycan (PG) cleavage rather than direct protein interactions, which activates ITGα8 mechanosensing specifically in cardiac fibroblasts. Among integrin family members tested, ITGα8 shows selective responsiveness to ADAMTS1-mediated mechanical cues, as confirmed by tunable-stiffness hydrogel experiments and validated through comprehensive proteomic and functional analyses. ITGα8 deficiency rescues ADAMTS1-induced cardiac dysfunction and reduces pathological scar formation. These findings reveal a previously unrecognized ADAMTS1-ITGα8 mechanotransduction pathway, representing a promising therapeutic target for optimizing post-infarction cardiac remodeling.

In this commentary, we review a growing body of work demonstrating that the microbiome plays a crucial yet underexplored role in women's reproductive health. This work has shown that microbial communities produce substrates that support metabolic, immune, and hormonal functions during this critical period, affecting fertility, pregnancy outcomes, and offspring health. Women with reproductive disorders, including endometriosis, polycystic ovarian syndrome, primary ovarian insufficiency, and recurrent pregnancy loss, harbor distinct microbial signatures. Animal studies provide key mechanistic insights, showing that disruption of microbiota accelerates ovarian aging, but translating these findings to human preconception health requires careful consideration. While these findings are compelling, this emerging field currently lacks a clear understanding of how microbial signals affect reproductive tissues through metabolites, immune responses, or hormonal pathways. We outline criteria for establishing microbial causation in preconception health, including sufficiency, necessity, specificity, and timing. Moving beyond correlations involves selecting appropriate models, focusing on key developmental windows, conducting longitudinal studies before conception, and investigating how specific microbial metabolites influence reproductive outcomes. Incorporating microbiome research into preconception care could lead to the development of new therapies and interventions. While the principles outlined here primarily address preconception reproductive health, they also offer a framework for microbiome research in general, emphasizing the need for a mechanistic understanding, timely interventions, and progress from association to causation in this rapidly evolving field.

Here, we employ the discriminative dimensionality reduction tree (DDRTree) method to routine clinical data from 18,733 Chinese individuals with obesity enrolled in the nationwide China Cardiometabolic Disease and Cancer Cohort (4C) study. We identify five distinct metabolic phenotypes, among which the phenotype characterized by hyperglycemia and insulin resistance exhibits a higher risk of glycemic deterioration, while the phenotype characterized by hypertension and dyslipidemia demonstrates an elevated risk of microvascular and macrovascular diseases. These findings are validated in an independent prospective cohort. Additionally, we reveal distinctive metabolomic features that contribute to the heterogeneity of obesity in the 4C study. To translate our findings into practice, we develop a user-friendly online tool to assess event risks in the obese population. Overall, our analysis illustrates the underlying phenotypic variations influencing subsequent obesity-related outcomes, emphasizing the importance of precision medicine in obesity management.

10.1177/1060028015606469	Association Between Prenatal Acetaminophen Exposure and Future Risk of Attention	Hoover RM, Hayes VA, Erramouspe J	OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of prenatal acetaminophen exposure on the future development of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children. DATA SOURCES: Literature searches of MEDLINE (1975 to June 2015), International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1975 to June 2015), and Cochrane Database (publications through June 2015) for prospective clinical trials assessing the relationship of prenatal acetaminophen exposure and the development of attention deficit disorders or hyperactivity. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: Studies comparing self-reported maternal acetaminophen use during pregnancy to development of ADHD or ADHD-like behaviors in offspring between the ages of 3 and 12 years. DATA SYNTHESIS: Four studies examining the effects of prenatal acetaminophen exposure on subsequent ADHD behaviors were identified. Of these, one early study found no link to ADHD behaviors while the other studies found statistically significant correlations with the most prominent being a study finding a higher risk for using ADHD medications (hazard ratio = 1.29; 95% CI, 1.15-1.44) or having ADHD-like behaviors at age 7 years as determined by the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (risk ratio = 1.13; 95% CI, 1.01-1.27) in children whose mothers used acetaminophen during pregnancy. CONCLUSION: While there does appear to be a mild correlation between prenatal acetaminophen use and the development of ADHD symptoms in children, current data do not provide sufficient evidence that prenatal acetaminophen exposure leads to development of ADHD symptoms late in life. Acetaminophen is a preferred option for pain management during pregnancy when compared with other medications such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or opioids for pyretic or pain relief.

Understanding their longitudinal trajectory in the untreated state is key to their use as potential markers of pharmacodynamic response. To this end, we undertook a large-scale proteomic study in well-phenotyped cohorts to identify biomarker candidates of ALS disease state and disease progression. METHODS: Clinical phenotypic data and biofluid samples, collected from patients with ALS and healthy controls through multiple longitudinal natural history studies, were used to identify biomarker candidates. Slow off-rate modified aptamer (SOMAmer)-based relatively quantitative measurement of ~7,000 proteins was performed in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), with immunoassay validation of candidates of interest. RESULTS: We identified 329 plasma proteins significantly differentially regulated between ALS and controls (adjusted p-value <0.05), with 25 showing >40% relative abundance. PDLIM3, TNNT2, and MYL11 had the greatest log-fold elevation, whereas ANTXR2 and ART3 had the greatest log-fold reduction. A similar set of plasma proteins was found to increase (eg, PDLIM3, TNNT2, and MYL11) or decrease (eg, ANTXR2, ART3, and MSTN) with disease progression. CSF proteins with the greatest log-fold elevation included NEFL, NEFH, CHIT1, CA3, MYL11, and GPNMB. These results were confirmed in an independent replication cohort. Moreover, tissue-specific signature enrichment suggests a significant contribution of muscle as a source of these biomarkers. Plasma KCNIP3 was elevated by ~60% in those on riluzole. Immunoassays provided orthogonal validation of plasma TNNT2 and CSF GPNMB. INTERPRETATION: We identified an array of novel biomarkers with the potential to serve as response biomarkers to aid therapy development, as well as to shed light on the underlying biology of disease.

10.1016/j.bcp.2025.117372	Advances in understanding the mechanism of noncoding RNA (ncRNA)-mediated	Ge C, Yuan Y, Li X, Zhang J, Ling J, Zheng X, Wu Y, Huang X, Yang P, Liu X, Zhang D, Liu J, Zhang J, Yu P	Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), recently reclassified as metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), has emerged as the most prevalent chronic liver disorder worldwide, progressing from simple steatosis to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), fibrosis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Increasing evidence highlights the pivotal role of immune-inflammatory responses in NAFLD pathogenesis, with macrophage polarization serving as a key regulatory mechanism that influences disease initiation, progression, and potential resolution. Noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs), including microRNAs (miRNAs), long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), and circular RNAs (circRNAs), have emerged as essential modulators of macrophage phenotype and function by influencing transcriptional checkpoints, inflammatory signaling pathways, and intercellular communication. Recent findings further underscore the role of lipotoxicity-associated ncRNAs in transmitting stress signals from hepatocytes to macrophages, thereby amplifying immune dysregulation and fibrogenesis. This review summarizes current knowledge on ncRNA expression and function in NAFLD, with a focus on their regulatory roles in macrophage polarization across disease stages, from steatosis to HCC. We categorize ncRNA-targeted therapies into specific approaches (e.g., miRNA mimics or inhibitors) and nonspecific interventions (e.g., exosome- or compound-mediated modulation), and further discuss their therapeutic potential and challenges, as well as emerging macrophage-targeted delivery systems. By linking molecular mechanisms to therapeutic strategies, we propose ncRNA-based modulation of macrophage polarization as a promising avenue for the diagnosis and treatment of NAFLD.

However, achieving prediabetes remission, that is, reaching normal glucose regulation according to American Diabetes Association criteria, is more efficient in preventing T2D than solely reaching weight loss goals. Here we present a post hoc analysis of the large, multicenter, randomized, controlled Prediabetes Lifestyle Intervention Study (PLIS), demonstrating that prediabetes remission is achievable without weight loss or even weight gain, and that it also protects against incident T2D. The underlying mechanisms include improved insulin sensitivity, β-cell function and increments in β-cell-GLP-1 sensitivity. Weight gain was similar in those achieving prediabetes remission (responders) compared with nonresponders; however, adipose tissue was differentially redistributed in responders and nonresponders when compared against each other-while nonresponders increased visceral adipose tissue mass, responders increased adipose tissue in subcutaneous depots. The findings were reproduced in the US Diabetes Prevention Program. These data uncover essential pathways for prediabetes remission without weight loss and emphasize the need to include glycemic targets in current clinical practice guidelines to improve T2D prevention.

Here, we developed a single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) immunotherapy cohort (N = 27) and a spatial transcriptomics cohort (N = 88) to elucidate metabolic crosstalk associated with therapeutic efficacy in TNBC. We illustrated that heme binding protein 2 (HEBP2)(high) tumor cells (featured by active glutathione metabolism) and CCL3(+) macrophages (characterized by oxidative metabolism) indicated immunotherapy efficacy and were quantitatively and spatially negatively correlated. HEBP2-mediated glutamine face-off between these cell types induced this phenomenon. Mechanistically, HEBP2 disrupted FOXA1 cytoplasmic phase separation, promoting its nuclear translocation to upregulate glutathione S-transferase P1 (GSTP1) expression and glutamine consumption in tumor cells. This metabolic shift induced ferroptosis of CCL3(+) macrophages, impairing the antitumor immunity. The utilization of a GSTP1 inhibitor sensitized TNBC to immunotherapy. Collectively, we delineate a tumor-macrophage metabolic checkpoint governed by the HEBP2/GSTP1 axis and pioneer single-cell-level immunometabolism as a paradigm for evaluating immunotherapeutic vulnerabilities.

Insufficient apoptosis of fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLSs) significantly contributes to the pathogenesis of RA by promoting hyperplasia and inflammatory cytokine secretion. Celastrol (CLT), a pentacyclic triterpene derived from Tripterygium wilfordii, has shown promise in inducing apoptosis via endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-mediated pathways. However, its clinical application is limited by poor solubility and off-target effects. Targeted delivery of CLT to FLSs and their ER could enhance therapeutic efficacy while minimizing toxicity.

This review delineates current knowledge on the interconnected mechanisms underlying aging-related diseases, including atherosclerosis, obesity, sarcopenia, neurodegenerative disorders, rheumatoid arthritis, and cancer. We further discuss the critical role of contributing factors such as microbiome dysbiosis, sex differences, and exosome-mediated communication in modulating disease progression. Advancements in multi-omics technologies and AI-driven biomarkers, particularly epigenetic clocks, are highlighted for their ability to precisely quantify biological aging and stratify disease risk. Finally, we explore the therapeutic potential and promising clinical trials of targeting these shared mechanisms with senolytics, mitochondrial enhancers, and immunomodulators, offering a paradigm shift from disease-specific treatment to holistic interventions designed to extend healthspan.

However, EXO1 loss is well-tolerated, suggesting the existence of compensatory mechanisms that could be exploited in DDR-deficient cancers. Using CRISPR screening, we find EXO1 loss as synthetic lethal with many DDR genes somatically inactivated in cancers, including Fanconi Anaemia (FA) pathway and BRCA1-A complex genes. We also identify the spliceosome factor and tumour suppressor ZRSR2 as synthetic lethal with loss of EXO1 and show that ZRSR2-deficient cells are attenuated for FA pathway activation, exhibiting cisplatin sensitivity and radial chromosome formation. Furthermore, FA or ZRSR2 deficiencies depend on EXO1 nuclease activity and can be potentiated in combination with PARP inhibitors or ionizing radiation. Finally, we uncover dysregulated replication-coupled repair as the driver of synthetic lethality between EXO1 and FA pathway attributable to defective fork reversal, elevated replication fork speeds, post-replicative single stranded DNA exposure and DNA damage. These findings implicate EXO1 as a synthetic lethal vulnerability and promising drug target in a broad spectrum of DDR-deficient cancers unaddressed by current therapies.

This study aimed to characterize the molecular epidemiology and antimicrobial susceptibility profiles of B. pertussis isolates circulating in Guangzhou, China. METHODS: A total of 91 culture-confirmed pertussis cases in Guangzhou between January 2020 and August 2024 were enrolled and studied. B. pertussis isolates (from January 2020 to May 2024) were recovered from 62 cases. All isolates underwent antigenic genotyping and phylogenetic analysis based on whole-genome sequencing. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing using E-test was performed on 12 representative isolates. RESULTS: The majority of culture-confirmed cases occurred in children under 1 year of age who were unvaccinated or partially vaccinated. Genotypic analysis revealed a significant shift: only 3 isolates (all from 2022) harbored the ptxP1 allele, while the remaining 59 exhibited ptxP3. Three types of pertactin (prn) allele were identified: prn1 (4.84%, 3/62), prn2 (11.29%, 7/62), prn150 (80.65%, 50/62), and 2 untyped prn allele. By 2024, prn150 became the predominant allele. Phylogenetic analysis revealed distinct branches separating ptxP1 and ptxP3 lineages. E-test results demonstrated that all macrolide-resistant isolates (exhibiting MICs > 256 mg/L for erythromycin, azithromycin, and clarithromycin) carried the A2047G mutation in 23S rRNA gene. The proportion of isolates harboring this mutation increased significantly after 2022 and dominated by 2024. All tested isolates displayed low MICs to alternative agents: trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (MICs ≤ 0.5/9.5 mg/L), cefoperazone/sulbactam (MICs ≤ 0.064/0.032 mg/L), and piperacillin/tazobactam (MICs ≤ 0.064/4 mg/L). Notably, macrolide-resistant isolates harboring ptxA1-ptxP3-prn150 genotype formed a distinct sub-clone within the ptxP3 clade. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate the current dominance of macrolide-resistant B. pertussis strain harboring ptxP3 and prn150 in Guangzhou since 2024. This study provides epidemiological and microbiological insights to guide local pertussis control strategies and to offer antimicrobial resistance monitoring efforts.

10.1007/s10522-025-10324-w	Multifaceted dynamics of circadian timing system influence aging and longevity.	Jagota A, Khan ZA, Sharma SA, Priyanka	Circadian time keeping system (CTS) consisting of network of central and peripheral clocks regulates physiological, metabolic, and behavioural processes in alignment with the 24 hour. Desynchrony between central and peripheral clocks contributes to the pathogenesis of age-related conditions such as metabolic syndrome, cognitive decline, immune dysfunction, and neurodegenerative diseases etc. Sex-specific susceptibilities further modulate circadian resilience, with hormonal changes and redox imbalances playing key roles in the aging trajectory. Immune senescence and hormonal dampening, particularly in cortisol and melatonin rhythms, exacerbate circadian misalignment, accelerating systemic decline with aging. Interestingly, aging and clock dysfunction is a bidirectional process, i.e. aging progressively influences circadian rhythms across multiple levels and vice versa, from the molecular architecture of core clock gene feedback loops to the functionality of the central pacemaker-the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN)-and its coordination with peripheral oscillators. This review critically highlights the complex alterations in circadian mechanisms associated with aging, including diminished transcriptional rhythmicity, epigenetic drift, mitochondrial desynchronization, and disruptions in neurotransmitter systems. Such changes in turn leads to weakened SCN output, impaired photic entrainment, and loss of temporal coherence across organ systems. Further, this review demonstrates CTS and aging at multiple levels such as behavioural, physiological, biochemical and molecular levels are linked in push-pull mechanism i.e., the breakdown in the harmony of circadian rhythms at systemic level pushes the organism towards early aging and aging in turn is linked to CTS disorders.

Batsch seeds (Taoren), which were the components of promoting circulation and removing stasis in the anti-fibrotic herbal--- Fuzheng Huayu Formula (FZHY). It has demonstrated efficacy in alleviating hepatic fibrosis and portal hypertension (PH); however, its pharmacological mechanisms remain unclear. AIM OF THE STUDY: The aim is to investigate the effects and molecular mechanisms of DTF on liver fibrosis and PH. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In vivo experiments were evaluated using a CCl(4)-induced mouse model with rivaroxaban (RIVA) as a drug control. PH was assessed by direct puncture method. Fibrosis was assessed by Sirius red staining and hydroxyproline. Network pharmacology analysis predicted the potential molecules or signal mediators. In vitro, an LX-2 cells was activated with ET-1, and Y-33075 used as a drug control. ELISA, Western blot, immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence were conducted to assess the target expression of ET-1, ENDRA, ROCK, cAMP, PKA, MLC and p-MLC. RESULTS: DTF or RIVA could alleviate liver fibrosis and PH compared to the model group. Network pharmacology analysis suggested that cAMP/PKA/ROCK signaling pathway acted as a key target in DTF. In vivo, DTF or RIVA suppressed ET-1, EDNRA and ROCK expression, enhanced cAMP and PKA expression. In vitro, DTF or Y-33075 attenuated the activation of LX-2 cells induced by ET-1, down-regulated ROCK and p-MLC expression, up-regulated cAMP and PKA expression. CONCLUSIONS: DTF alleviates liver fibrosis and PH by regulating the cAMP/PKA/ROCK signaling pathway in activated HSCs.	Journal of ethnopharmacology	25/09/2025
10.1016/j.biopha.2025.118608	Immune cell dynamics and their role in cardiac injury: Mechanisms and therapeutic	Liu C, Wu R, Yang H, Yao Y	Cardiovascular injury initiates a temporally regulated immune cascade that governs both tissue damage and repair. Neutrophils, macrophages, dendritic cells, and T cells contribute distinct yet overlapping functions during acute inflammation, resolution, and chronic remodeling. This review synthesizes recent findings from single-cell transcriptomics, spatial omics, immunometabolism, and neuroendocrine-immune interactions to delineate immune cell dynamics across major cardiac diseases, including myocardial infarction, heart failure, viral myocarditis, hypertensive remodeling, and sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy. We further examine how immune cells communicate with cardiomyocytes, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and neurohormonal regulators to shape the myocardial microenvironment. Particular emphasis is placed on macrophage polarization, regulatory T cell activity, extracellular vesicle-mediated signaling, and metabolic checkpoints as key determinants of immune behavior. Based on these mechanistic insights, we propose a framework for precision immunotherapy that integrates immune profiling, metabolic status, and neuroendocrine cues to guide individualized interventions. Emerging strategies-including low-dose interleukin-2, immune checkpoint blockade, mesenchymal stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles, and immunometabolic reprogramming-are highlighted as promising means to recalibrate immunity toward tissue repair. Overall, this review provides a translational perspective aimed at shifting cardiovascular therapy from non-specific immunosuppression to adaptive, stage-specific immunomodulation.

We retrospectively evaluated 95 patients with EMD undergoing FDG PET/CT imaging for metabolic response assessment using visual Deauville Scores (DS) and total lesion glycolysis (TLG). TLG responses were categorized as complete metabolic response (CMR; 100% reduction), major metabolic response (MMR; <100% to ≥50% reduction), and non-significant metabolic response (NMR; <50% reduction). The median progression-free survival (PFS) differed significantly by DS (22.4 vs. 4.3 vs. 2.8 months for DS ≤ 3, =4, and =5, respectively; p < 0.0001) and by TLG response (36.5 vs. 5.4 vs. 2.2 months for CMR, MMR, NMR; p < 0.0001). TLG offered better discrimination than DS, with approximately one-third of patients in each DS stratum being reclassified by the TLG stratification. In a multivariable analysis, TLG response [HR 2.6 (95% CI: 1.8-3.8), p < 0.0001] remained independently prognostic after adjusting for cytogenetics, triple-class refractoriness, and de novo EMD status. The 18-month OS rates were 89%, 42% and 19% for the TLG CMR, MMR, and NMR cohorts (p < 0.001). These findings support the integration of TLG into response criteria for EMD.	Leukemia	28/09/2025
10.1016/j.phymed.2025.157330	Astragaloside IV potentiates cisplatin sensitivity in triple-negative breast	Bai B, Zhang L, Zhang Y, Yue R, Lu Y, Shi R, Zhou Q	"BACKGROUND: Astragaloside IV (As), a bioactive tetracyclic triterpenoid saponin from Astragalus membranaceus, exhibits diverse pharmacological properties including anti-inflammatory, anticancer and immunomodulatory activities. However, its potential role as a targeted therapeutic agent for cisplatin sensitization in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) via the STING signaling pathway remains unexplored. PURPOSE: This study aimed to investigate the cisplatin-sensitizing potential of As in TNBC and elucidate its underlying molecular mechanisms. METHODS: Bioinformatic analysis identified key module genes from public databases using weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), followed by feature selection via least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression. Immune microenvironment characterization was performed using CIBERSORT deconvolution analysis. Potential targets of As in TNBC were systematically identified through multi-database mining, protein-protein interaction (PPI) network construction, pathway enrichment analysis and molecular docking simulations. Transcriptomic profiling revealed treatment-induced differentially expressed genes and enriched signaling pathways in murine tissues. The combinatorial anti-tumor efficacy was evaluated using orthotopic TNBC model (4T1 cell-derived) in vivo and 4T1, MDA-MB-231, and MCF-7 cell lines in vitro. Mechanistic validation was conducted through integrated in vivo and in vitro experiments. RESULTS: Integrated bioinformatics analysis (WGCNA, LASSO, and CIBERSORT) identified STING within a chemotherapy-sensitive module among six endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated gene co-expression networks. STING exhibited significant enrichment in antitumor immune pathways and correlated with heterogeneous immune cell infiltration. KEGG pathway analysis implicated immune/inflammatory signaling and DNA damage responses in the cisplatin-sensitizing effects of As. Molecular docking confirmed stable binding between As and STING (binding energy: -36.09 kcal/mol). In vivo, As synergistically enhanced cisplatin's tumor growth inhibition while mitigating cisplatin-induced toxicity, including weight loss, nephrotoxicity, and systemic inflammation. Transcriptomic and immunohistochemical analyses validated As-mediated DNA damage, STING pathway activation, immune cell recruitment. In vitro mechanistic studies using DNase I and STING inhibitor (C-176) demonstrated As potentiated cisplatin via cell cycle arrest, mitochondrial dysfunction and STING cascade activation. C-176 weakened the antitumor activity of As- cisplatin combination treatment. CONCLUSION: As synergistically enhances the therapeutic efficacy of cisplatin against TNBC while ameliorating its adverse effects, primarily through activation of the STING signaling pathway and potentiation of antitumor immunity. This dual mechanism-simultaneously boosting host defense (""Fuzheng"") and inhibiting tumor progression (""Kang`ai"")-provides a molecular basis for the observed ""Qi-tonifying"" properties of As in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), bridging TCM with contemporary immunopharmacology."

10.1186/s43556-025-00312-4	5-Hydroxytryptamine promotes non-small cell lung cancer metastasis via the	Sun J, Liu CG, Chen S, Zhou H, Liu X, Wang FR, Luo YW, Zang D, Chen J	Tumor metastasis severely compromises the prognosis of patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), yet the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. The biogenic amine 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), derived from tryptophan (Trp), has been reported to promote tumor growth, but its role in NSCLC metastasis has not been fully elucitated. In this study, fecal metabolomic profiling revealed significant enrichment of Trp metabolism and serotonergic synapse pathways in patients with NSCLC metastasis. Notably, the levels of 5-HT in peripheral blood showed a positive correlation with fecal Trp concentrations in NSCLC patients. Functional experiments demonstrated that 5-HT promoted NSCLC cell migration, invasion, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and metastasis by inhibiting the expression of small nuclear ribonucleoprotein polypeptide G (SNRPG). RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) further identified cyclin-dependent kinase 14 (CDK14) as a critical downstream target of SNRPG. SNRPG downregulated CDK14 expression, thereby restraining malignant phenotypes in NSCLC cells. Furthermore, SNRPG negatively regulated the protein levels of Wilms tumor 1 (WT1) by directly binding to it. Loss of SNRPG led to WT1 accumulation, which in turn bound to the CDK14 promoter and activated transcription, ultimately driving NSCLC metastasis. These findings collectively suggest that the 5-HT/SNRPG/WT1/CDK14 axis plays a pivotal role in promoting NSCLC metastasis and highlight 5-HT and SNRPG as potential therapeutic targets for NSCLC metastasis.

10.1016/j.jare.2025.09.053	CircCDYL promotes glycolysis to drive the progression of nasopharyngeal	Yang Y, Wang Y, Qu H, Wang D, Ge J, Wu P, Yan Q, Chen P, Xiang B, Zhou M, Guo C, Xiong W, Shi L, Zeng Z	INTRODUCTION: CircRNAs play critical roles in the onset and progression of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), although their underlying mechanisms remain incompletely understood. OBJECTIVES: In this study, we investigated the mechanism of circCDYL in promoting the proliferation, invasion and migration of NPC in vitro and in vivo. METHODS: We reanalyzed RNA sequencing data (GSE137543, PRJNA391554) and validated findings with RT-qPCR and in situ hybridization experiments. Functional assays were subsequently performed both in vitro and in vivo. RESULTS: We identified circCDYL as being highly expressed in NPC, with its expression levels positively correlated with clinical tumor staging. Functionally, circCDYL promotes tumor proliferation and metastasis both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, circCDYL binds to the 3'-UTR of LDHA mRNA, stabilizing it and upregulating LDHA protein expression, thereby enhancing cellular glycolysis and increasing lactate production and accumulation. The elevated lactate, in turn, promotes lactylation of the actin-binding protein CFL1 at lysine 22. This modification reduces cell adhesion and stiffness, ultimately facilitating tumor cell proliferation, invasion, and migration. CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that circCDYL and its downstream pathways may serve as potential diagnostic markers or therapeutic targets for NPC.	Journal of advanced research	26/09/2025
10.1155/crp/9292002	The Relationship Between the Fibrinogen-to-Albumin Ratio and Short-Term Mortality	Guo LL, Liu P, Cai LN, Hu L, Zhou YS	Background: Recent studies have identified an association between the fibrinogen-to-albumin ratio (FAR) and the prognosis of coronary heart disease; however, evidence regarding its significance in heart failure patients remains limited. This study aims to examine the relationship between the FAR and short-term mortality among individuals with heart failure. Methods: In this retrospective cohort study, we conducted an analysis of clinical data from patients with heart failure who were hospitalized at Zigong Fourth People's Hospital from December 2016 to June 2019. The primary exposure variable was the FAR, while the outcomes of interest were mortality rates at 28 days and 3 months. Multivariate logistic regression evaluated FAR's independent association with short-term mortality, with predictive accuracy assessed via ROC curves and subgroup consistency through stratified analyses. Furthermore, smooth curve fitting was utilized to investigate the linear relationship, and a series of sensitivity analyses were conducted to validate the robustness of the findings. Results: The analysis included 1880 participants, of whom 58.1% were females and 54.1% were aged 60-80 years. Our study showed that a one standard deviation rise in the FAR was linked to a 45% increase in 28-day mortality (OR = 1.45, 95% CI = 1.02-2.06, p=0.04) after adjusting for potential confounding factors. The 28-day mortality rate was markedly elevated in the high FAR group (FAR > 0.126) compared to the low FAR group (OR = 4.01, 95% CI = 1.17-13.82, p=0.028). Comparable findings were noted at the 3-month mark. There were no significant interactions found in the subgroup analysis. A linear association was identified between FAR and short-term mortality. The optimal FAR cutoff value for predicting 28-day mortality was 0.156 (sensitivity 68.0%, specificity 59.4%, AUC = 0.654), while for 3-month mortality, it was 0.156 (sensitivity 68.0%, specificity 58.3%, AUC = 0.647). Sensitivity analyses corroborated the robustness of our findings. Conclusion: A positive correlation exists between the FAR and short-term mortality among Chinese patients with heart failure. These findings underscore the necessity for further investigation into the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms and potential therapeutic interventions associated with FAR in the context of heart failure.

The emergence of non-cancer-related factors and time-dependent trends underscores the need for advanced analytical frameworks to unravel their complex interplay. METHODS: We analyzed the Pembro-real 5Y registry, a global real-world dataset of 1050 patients treated across 61 institutions in 14 countries with a long-term follow-up and a large panel of baseline variables. Two complementary approaches were employed: ridge regression, chosen for its ability to address multicollinearity while retaining interpretability, and not another imputation method (NAIM), a transformer-based artificial intelligence model designed to handle missing data without imputation. Endpoints included risk of death at 6, 12, 24, 60 months and 5-year survival. RESULTS: The ridge regression model achieved a c-statistic of 0.66 (95% CI: 0.59 to 0.72) for the risk of death and an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.72 (95% CI: 0.65 to 0.78) for 5-year survival, identifying Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG-PS)≥2, increasing age, and metastatic burden as primary risk factors. However, wide CIs for some predictors highlighted statistical instability. NAIM demonstrated robust handling of missing data, with a c-index of 62.98±2.11 for risk of death and an AUC of 60.52±3.71 for 5-year survival.

10.3389/fncel.2025.1655342	Alzheimer's disease: where do we stand now and what are the strategic	González A, Geywitz S, Maccioni RB	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a multifactorial neurodegenerative disease, the primary cause of dementia in people over 65 years old. AD is characterized by two molecular hallmarks, the intracellular neurofibrillary tangles of tau and amyloid beta oligomers, which are aggregates of hyperphosphorylated tau and amyloid beta peptides, respectively. These hallmarks gave rise to the two main theories that have opened the way for available treatments, such as FDA-approved memantine, and Aβ (aducanumab, lecanemab) and tau immunotherapies. Tau immunotherapy, especially multitarget approaches, has been recently proven effective. However, drugs against amyloid plaques had a non-successful outcome, despite their contributions to AD knowledge. An innovative approach comes from the multitarget concept, based on bioactive molecules and nutraceuticals. Interestingly, the use of early detection biomarkers such as Alz-Tau(®), SIMOA(®), and the recent Lumipulse™ test, are an important support to orient AD therapies based on the modifications of the styles of life. This includes physical exercise, a healthy diet, mindfulness, and cognitive stimulation, among others. All of the above analyses are critical to switch the focus to the prevention of AD.

10.1007/s00421-010-1658-5	Association among basal serum BDNF, cardiorespiratory fitness and cardiovascular	Jung SH, Kim J, Davis JM, Blair SN, Cho HC	Evidence suggests that serum brain-derived neurotrophic factor (serum BDNF) can be affected by cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF), but this relationship is far from clear. Recent reports show an inverse relationship between serum BDNF and CRF in healthy individuals, and other studies suggest a possible association between serum BDNF and cardiovascular disease. However, the possible interaction between serum BDNF, CRF, and cardiovascular disease risk has not been studied. The purpose of this study was to examine the association among serum BDNF, CRF, and cardiovascular disease risk factors in healthy men. The investigation involved a large sample of men (n = 995, age range: 20-76 years) who live in the central area of South Korea and were recruited into the Preventive Health Study. Our study showed a significant inverse relationship between serum BDNF and relative VO(2)max (r = -0.412, p < 0.0001) and heart rate reserve (r = -0.194, p < 0.0001). Serum BDNF was positively correlated with body mass index (r = 0.80, p < 0.0001), total cholesterol (r = 0.185, p < 0.0001), and triglyceride (r = 0.320, p < 0.0001). Our data suggest that serum BDNF may be associated with effects of increased CRF on cardiovascular disease. However, more research is clearly needed before a determination of whether, and to what extent, serum BDNF may be responsible for some of the health benefits associated with CRF.

10.1126/sciadv.adx3827	USP13 stabilizes NLRP3 to facilitate inflammasome activation by preventing	Li YT, Li KY, Tao SS, Wang T, Lu Y, Chen H, Zhan YQ, Zhao K, Xiang SS, Li JJ, Gao HY, Yu M, Li CY, Wang L, Yang XM, Ren GM, Yin RH	NOD-, LRR-, and pyrin domain-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) has a fundamental role in host defense and is involved in diverse inflammatory diseases. NLRP3 protein expression is tightly controlled by the ubiquitin system. In particular, NLRP3 protein degradation has been extensively studied. In contrast, the mechanisms to stabilize NLRP3 protein are much less known. Here, we demonstrated the critical role of ubiquitin-specific protease 13 (USP13) in regulating NLRP3 protein stability and inflammasome activation independently of its deubiquitinating enzyme activity. USP13 competes with E3 ubiquitin ligase TRIM31 to interact with NLRP3 and prevents TRIM31-mediated NLRP3 ubiquitination at K192 and K496 sites, thereby inhibiting proteasomal degradation of NLRP3. USP13 deficiency reduces NLRP3 protein expression in both human and mouse macrophages, which consequently inhibits NLRP3 inflammasome assembly and activation. Accordingly, deficiency of USP13 attenuates monosodium urate crystal-induced mouse peritonitis. Overall, our findings reveal a previously unrecognized regulatory mechanism of NLRP3 stability by USP13 and provide a potential therapeutic target for NLRP3-driven diseases.

Leg swelling and shortness of breath are the most frequent patient complaints. Despite significant advancements in patient care pathways, the proper diagnosis, treatment and disposition of AHF may be further improved in emergency settings. The present document is an expert consensus document outlining key points in diagnosis, treatment and decision-making of patients being diagnosed with AHF by EMS and in the ED. Pillars of correct diagnosis include detailed clinical assessment and accurate interpretation of natriuretic peptides, while chest X-ray is still the most frequent image test used in ED, that could be substituted by ultrasonography exploration in appropriate patients. Quick identification of the most severe cases needing intensive care is mandatory, most of them characterized by hemodynamic instability, ventilatory failure or acute coronary syndrome needing intervention. Treatment could be started in prehospital settings by EMS, and loop diuretics are still the cornerstone of decongestive therapy. Measurement of diuresis and natriuresis shortly after provision of the first diuretic bolus is recommended, as it can help in detecting patients with poor diuretic response for dose augmentation or drug escalation with the addition of acetazolamide or thiazides. For selected patients, vasodilators (especially for acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema phenotype) or inotropes/vasopressors (for those with cardiogenic shock) can be needed. Oxygen therapy should be provided to patients with air-room SpO2 below 95%, and noninvasive ventilation is an option for patients with respiratory distress. After provision of ED care, a correct decision of patient discharge or hospitalization is paramount, and risk stratification can help in this regard. Other key points of AHF management in the ED include adequate diagnosis and management of triggers of the AHF episode; to take aspects of patient frailty into account; to avoid lines, catheters, and patient overstay in the ED where possible; and to ensure a proper follow-up plan after discharge from the hospital.

10.3390/cancers13030427	Cancer Treatment-Induced Accelerated Aging in Cancer Survivors: Biology and	Wang S, Prizment A, Thyagarajan B, Blaes A	"Rapid improvements in cancer survival led to the realization that many modalities used to treat or control cancer may cause accelerated aging in cancer survivors. Clinically, ""accelerated aging"" phenotypes in cancer survivors include secondary cancers, frailty, chronic organ dysfunction, and cognitive impairment, all of which can impact long-term health and quality of life in cancer survivors. The treatment-induced accelerated aging in cancer survivors could be explained by telomere attrition, cellular senescence, stem cell exhaustion, DNA damage, and epigenetic alterations. Several aging clocks and biomarkers of aging have been proposed to be potentially useful in estimating biological age, which can provide specific information about how old an individual is biologically independent of chronological age. Measuring biological age in cancer survivors may be important for two reasons. First, it can better predict the risk of cancer treatment-related comorbidities than chronological age. Second, biological age may provide additional value in evaluating the effects of treatments and personalizing cancer therapies to maximize efficacy of treatment. A deeper understanding of treatment-induced accelerated aging in individuals with cancer may lead to novel strategies that reduce the accelerated aging and improve the quality of life in cancer survivors."

This phase 1/2 study evaluated the safety, pharmacokinetics, immunogenicity, and preliminary anti-tumor activity of tecotabart vedotin in patients with advanced solid tumors, with a focus on CLDN18.2-positive gastric/gastroesophageal junction (G/GEJ) cancer. METHODS: This open-label, multicenter study utilized a Bayesian adaptive design. Phase 1 enrolled patients with advanced solid tumors; phase 2 focused on CLDN18.2-positive G/GEJ, pancreatic, biliary tract cancer, or gastrointestinal tumors with low to moderate CLDN18.2 expression. Tecotabart vedotin was administered at 0.2-2.8 mg/kg every 3 weeks (Q3W) or 1.8-2.0 mg/kg every 2 weeks (Q2W). Primary endpoints included dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) and safety in phase 1, and objective response rate (ORR) in phase 2. Secondary endpoints included safety, pharmacokinetics, immunogenicity, and other anti-tumor activity outcomes. RESULTS: Overall, 153 patients received tecotabart vedotin (phase 1: 38; phase 2: 115). DLTs occurred in 5 patients at higher dose levels. The maximum tolerated dose was 2.4 mg/kg Q3W; recommended phase 2 doses were 1.8 mg/kg Q2W and 2.4 mg/kg Q3W. Among 52 evaluable patients with CLDN18.2-positive G/GEJ cancer receiving 1.8 mg/kg Q2W, ORR was 32.7 % (95 % confidence interval [CI] 20.3-47.1), with median progression-free survival of 4.9 months (95 % CI 2.7-6.9), and overall survival of 10.9 months (95 % CI 9.1-17.1). Adverse events were manageable and consistent with monomethyl auristatin E-based ADCs. CONCLUSIONS: Tecotabart vedotin demonstrated encouraging anti-tumor activity and manageable safety in CLDN18.2-positive G/GEJ cancer, supporting further clinical development in gastrointestinal malignancies.

Existing therapies target these and other autoreactive lymphocytes but their side effects include general immunosuppression and toxicity. Because the Kv1.3 potassium channel is highly expressed by chronically activated autoreactive T(EM)s, we investigated whether specific targeting of mitochondrial Kv1.3 using the pharmacological inhibitor PAPTP could selectively kill these T(EM)s in patients and mice with MS. 1 µM PAPTP targeted and reduced the number of autoreactive T(EM)s in blood samples from relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) patients, leaving other T cell populations unaffected. Remarkably, pre-treatment of the entire T cell population with PAPTP during adoptive transfer of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) killed T(EM)s and completely prevented disease onset in this mouse model. Moreover, PAPTP selectively eliminated activated T(EM)s and halted EAE progression when administered following disease onset. Our findings reveal the potential of PAPTP as an effective treatment for MS without adverse side effects.	EMBO molecular medicine	29/09/2025

Although the exact aetiology remains unknown, accumulating evidence has shown that disruption of the gut-brain axis may be related to the occurrence and development of chronic intestinal inflammation. Psychological disorders are highly prevalent in patients with IBD. However, an association between altered behaviour and dysregulated metabolic pathways within the gut-brain axis is yet to be explored. METHODS: Metabolic multiplexed phenotyping system involving indirect calorimetry and flow-through respirometry monitors was used to assess energy metabolism in Winnie mice with spontaneous chronic colitis and C57BL/6 littermates. Depressive and anxiety-like behaviours were evaluated with light dark, open field, grooming, elevated plus maze, and forced swimming tests. To investigate underlying mechanisms of the metabolic changes in Winnie mice, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, fatty acid ß-oxidation, tricarboxylic acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation gene expressions were determined by transcriptome analysis using high-throughput sequencing of mRNA extracted from the distal colon and brain samples. RESULTS: Our findings showed that energy metabolism and spontaneous activity were reduced in Winnie mice corresponding to alterations in the expression of cellular metabolism-associated genes in the distal colon. Winnie mice displayed depressive and anxiety-like behaviours reflecting downregulation of glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, fatty acid ß-oxidation, tricarboxylic acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation in the distal colon and brain. Subsequent analyses showed pro-inflammatory cytokine expression was upregulated in the Winnie mouse brain. CONCLUSIONS: These data provide evidence that the dysregulation of cellular metabolism within the gut-brain axis underlies changes in behaviour and energy metabolism in chronic intestinal inflammation.

10.1016/j.cub.2025.09.012	Reduced oxytocin signaling in the dBNST drives the transition from acute pain to	Fang S, Qin Y, Lian H, Zhong Y, Yang Y, Yu XD, Yang S, Liang J, Xiao W, Wen S, Zhang XM, Li B, Huang L	Transient sensory experiences can trigger sustained emotional disturbances, yet the underlying neural mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we show that acute pain induces persistent anxiety in male mice, independent of ongoing nociceptive input, through reduced oxytocin signaling in the dorsal bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (dBNST). Reactivating oxytocin receptors (Oxtrs) in the dBNST markedly alleviated anxiety-like behaviors following pain resolution. Mechanistically, chemogenetic inhibition of somatostatin-expressing (SST) neurons in the dBNST (dBNST(SST) neurons) abolished oxytocin's anxiolytic effects, while pharmacological blockade or selective knockdown of Oxtrs in these neurons increased anxiety-like behaviors. Transcriptomic and electrophysiological analyses further revealed that alterations in synaptic transmission and intrinsic excitability participate in this anxiety state. Together, these findings define a multilevel framework-spanning molecular, cellular, and circuit mechanisms-by which acute sensory input induces long-term emotional dysregulation. This study advances our understanding of pain-related affective disorders and highlights oxytocin signaling and dBNST(SST) neurons as promising therapeutic targets.	Current biology : CB	26/09/2025

The current obesity assessment indicators have poor ability to distinguish between fat and muscle. Relative fat mass (RFM) a new indicator of obesity that takes into account gender differences and can predict body fat conditions has advantage in this respect. This study aimed to investigate the potential association between RFM and OSA, as well as the possible mediating effect of hypertension. METHODS: This cross-sectional study used data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey conducted in 2005-2008 and 2015-2018. Multivariate logistic regression, restricted cubic splines (RCS), and subgroup analyses were performed to evaluate the association between RFM and OSA. In addition, the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) of different obesity indicators was compared to assess their predictive ability for OSA. Mediation analysis was used to explore the potential mediating role of hypertension in the positive correlation. RESULTS: The study included 13,532 participants with complete study data, of which 6854 were assessed as having OSA according to the criteria, accounting for 50.65% of the study population. The results of the multivariate logistic regression model with fully adjusted covariates showed that the odds ratio of RFM was 1.096 (95%CI:1.084-1.109, P < 0.001). The results of the RCS show that RFM is nonlinearly correlated with OSA (P for nonlinear < 0.01). Subgroup analysis showed that the association between RFM and OSA was stronger in female and people younger than 60. The ROC also indicates that, compared with the body roundness index and weight-adjusted-waist index, RFM showed potential as a predictor. Mediation analysis and sensitivity analysis showed that hypertension had a statistically significant but poorly robust mediating effect between RFM and OSA. CONCLUSION: There is a positive and nonlinear correlation between RFM and OSA. Hypertension plays a potential mediating role in the positive association between RFM and OSA, but its robustness is poor. RFM shows potential as a predictor of OSA, but more prospective studies are needed to confirm these findings and determine the causal relationship between RFM and OSA.	Nutrition journal	26/09/2025
10.1186/s12884-025-08116-8	Non-coding RNAs as diagnostic biomarkers for preeclampsia: a systematic review	Liu J, Zhao Q, Zhu Y	BACKGROUND: Preeclampsia (PE), a grave obstetric complication, mandates the expeditious formulation of efficacious early diagnostic strategies. Accumulating evidence suggests that non - coding RNAs (ncRNAs), which are present in maternal circulation and placental tissues, display abnormal expression patterns in patients with PE, underscoring their potential as diagnostic biomarkers. This systematic review and meta - analysis intends to assess the diagnostic accuracy of ncRNAs for the detection of PE. METHODS: A comprehensive search was carried out across seven databases (China National Knowledge Infrastructure [CNKI], Wanfang Database, VIP Database, PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and the Cochrane Library) up to December 25, 2024, to identify case - control and cohort studies exploring the diagnostic value of ncRNAs in PE. The quality of the studies was evaluated using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies - 2 (QUADAS - 2) tool and the Newcastle - Ottawa Scale (NOS), and publication bias was assessed using Deeks' funnel plot. The pooled sensitivity (SEN), specificity (SPE), diagnostic odds ratio (DOR), and area under the curve (AUC) were computed using Review Manager 5.4 and Meta - DiSc 1.4. RESULTS: Among the 2,201 identified studies, 40 fulfilled the inclusion criteria for qualitative synthesis. Forty - eight ncRNAs showed diagnostic potential, including 25 microRNAs (miRNAs), 9 long non - coding RNAs (lncRNAs), and 6 circular RNAs (circRNAs). The pooled sensitivity and specificity were 80% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 76-84%) and 82% (95% CI: 79-85%), respectively. Single miRNA assays presented superior diagnostic performance (sensitivity [SEN]: 85%, specificity [SPE]: 85%) in comparison to circRNAs (SEN: 80%, SPE: 79%). Notably, combinatorial panels consisting of 2-3 ncRNAs attained optimal diagnostic performance, with a sensitivity of 91% (95% CI: 88-94%), a specificity of 80% (95% CI: 76-84%), and an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.9418 (standard error [SE] = 0.0152). CONCLUSION: Circulating ncRNAs exhibit significant potential as diagnostic biomarkers for PE, with multi-analyte panels providing improved diagnostic accuracy compared to single-marker strategies.

10.1016/j.jare.2025.09.042	Therapeutic strategy for exosome-based bone regeneration to osteoporosis:	Dayanandan AP, Bello AB, Arai Y, Lee SJ, Lee SH	BACKGROUND: Osteoporosis (OP) is a progressive bone disease marked by reduced bone mass and microarchitectural deterioration, thereby increasing fracture risk. Current therapies only partly restore bone quality and often cause side effects with long-term use. Recent studies highlight exosomes, a subtype of extracellular vesicles, as key regulators of bone remodeling with promising regenerative potential. However, their role in osteoporosis remains underexplored. AIM OF REVIEW: This review aims to investigate how the established role of exosomes in bone regeneration may inform novel therapeutic strategies for osteoporosis. By linking general bone repair mechanisms with osteoporotic pathology, it evaluates the translational potential and limitations of exosome-based interventions. KEY SCIENTIFIC CONCEPTS OF REVIEW: Exosomes derived from mesenchymal stem cells, osteoblasts, osteoclasts, and macrophages regulate bone homeostasis by modulating osteogenesis, osteoclastogenesis, and immune responses. Their regenerative effects in non-osteoporotic settings are well documented. However, challenges such as exosome heterogeneity, rapid clearance, and poor targeting efficiency impede their direct application in osteoporosis. Recent bioengineering approaches, including osteogenic RNA or protein loading and surface modifications for bone targeting, show promise. Moreover, combining exosomes with immunomodulatory or synergistic therapies may further enhance their efficacy. Despite these advances, gaps persist in standardizing isolation techniques, ensuring batch consistency, and scaling up production for clinical use. This review consolidates current knowledge and outlines directions for adapting exosome-based bone regenerative strategies to osteoporosis treatment.	Journal of advanced research	25/09/2025

TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) is crucial for initiating the innate immune response against viral infection, although aberrant and ongoing TBK1 activation induces excessive production of type I interferons (IFN-I). Nonetheless, the mechanisms whereby energy metabolism controls TBK1 activation remain unclear. Here, we elucidate a mechanism linking energy metabolism to the inhibition of TBK1-induced IFN-I responses via the immune response gene 1 (IRG1)-itaconic acid axis. Mechanistically, itaconic acid and its derivatives alkylated TBK1 at Cys605, thereby disrupting TBK1 dimerization and rapid activation. IRG1, the enzyme that catalyzes itaconic acid production, is upregulated during late-phase viral infection and acts as a feedback regulator to restrain TBK1 activity. We developed itaconic acid-based compounds ITA-5/ITA-9 as alternative TBK1 inhibitors. ITA-5/ITA-9 effectively limited excess	Cell reports	26/09/2025
10.1136/jitc-2025-012345	Targeting SQLE-mediated cholesterol metabolism to enhance CD8(+) T cell	Qiao S, Zou H, Weng Y, Liu YF, Li W, Yu XJ, Li L, Zheng L, Xu J	BACKGROUND: The sustained effectiveness of anti-programmed cell death protein-1 (PD1) treatment is limited to a subgroup of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) due to the tumor microenvironment heterogeneity, highlighting the need to identify targetable biomarkers that synergize with PD1 blockade. Abnormal cholesterol metabolism plays a critical role in HCC progression, along with growing evidence indicating its complex immunomodulatory effects within the tumor microenvironment. However, the interplay between cholesterol homeostasis and immune evasion remains elusive. METHODS: Transcriptomic and clinical data from HCC datasets were analyzed to identify cholesterol metabolism-related targets. Multiplex immunostaining and flow cytometry were applied to examine the immune landscape association with squalene epoxidase (SQLE) in human and murine tumors. Mechanistic studies were conducted in vitro, and co-culture experiments of tumor cells and T cells were followed by metabolomics and transcriptome analyses. Therapeutic efficacy was evaluated in mouse HCC models. RESULTS: We demonstrated that elevated SQLE expression in human HCC was associated with poor clinical outcomes and correlated with reduced CD8(+) T cell infiltration and activation. Pharmacological inhibition or genetic knockdown of SQLE in tumor cells promoted CD8(+) T cell proliferation and activation in co-culture experiments. Untargeted metabolomics identified 27-hydrocholesterol, an oxysterol derived from tumor cells, as a key factor impairing CD8(+) T cell function via cholesterol dysregulation. SQLE inhibition in tumor cells suppressed oxysterols secretion, therefore overcoming cholesterol restrictions and enhancing the immune responses of CD8(+) T cells. Moreover, SQLE targeting with terbinafine restored antitumor immunity and synergized with anti-PD1 therapy in HCC. CONCLUSION: Targeting tumorous SQLE restores CD8(+) T cell function by overcoming cholesterol restrictions via oxysterol-SREBP2 signaling, highlighting SQLE as a potential therapeutic target to enhance immunotherapy efficacy in HCC.

Although multidomain interventions have shown promise as preventive strategies, the optimal combination of interventions remains unclear. This network meta-analysis aimed to compare and rank the relative efficacy of single-domain and multidomain lifestyle interventions for the prevention of cognitive impairment in older adults who are cognitively unimpaired. METHODS: We did a systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) published in PubMed and Embase from inception until the date of our search on May 7, 2024 following a preregistered protocol in PROSPERO (CRD42024601975). We included RCTs in older adults who are cognitively unimpaired evaluating lifestyle interventions targeting diet, physical exercise, cognitive training, social activity, and health education, either alone or in combination. The primary outcome was global cognition, analysed using random-effects network meta-analysis, reporting standardised mean differences (SMDs) and 95% CIs, and compared against health education, active control, or no intervention. Subgroup analyses explored potential age-related differences and the effect of intervention duration. Risk of bias was assessed using Cochrane Risk of Bias 2, and publication bias was evaluated by assessing funnel plot asymmetry. FINDINGS: Of the 10 200 citations identified and 1183 full texts screened for eligibility, we identified 109 eligible RCTs, including 23 010 participants (median age 70·1 years [IQR 68·7-73·8], 14 957 [65%] female and 8053 [35%] male). Compared with health education, significant improvements in global cognition were found for physical exercise and cognitive training combined (SMD 0·26 [95% CI 0·10-0·42; p=0·0011); cognitive training alone (SMD 0·21 [0·08-0·33]; p=0·00092); diet, physical exercise, cognitive training, and health education combined (SMD 0·14 [0·02-0·27]; p=0·028); and physical exercise alone (SMD 0·14 [0·05-0·22]; p=0·0014). Random-effects models using active control and no intervention as comparators yielded similarly significant effects for the aforementioned interventions, with effect sizes in the same order. Risk of bias was high in 44 (40%) studies, and publication bias was suggested in studies comparing interventions with health education. INTERPRETATION: Several single-domain and multidomain lifestyle interventions are efficacious at modulating global cognition in older adults who are cognitively unimpaired, with the combination of physical exercise and cognitive training demonstrating the strongest effect. Combining lifestyle interventions might enhance efficacy, but increased number of domains does not automatically translate into greater cognitive benefits. These findings support lifestyle interventions as key components of prevention strategies; however, their optimal combination requires further investigation. FUNDING: None.	The lancet.

These treatments, although effective in the short term in controlling congestion, do not prevent early readmissions and death, occurring in over 30% of patients in the 6 months after an AHF hospitalization. In the last years, studies showed that AHF diagnosis can be improved, early diuretic care can be optimized, and early intensive therapy with combined drug regimens can reduce the rate of adverse outcomes. However, unlike acute coronary syndromes, where guidelines have existed since 1996, there are no separate detailed guidelines for AHF. In a series of four papers (International Expert Opinion Series on AHF Management) an international expert group highlights important aspects of AHF care where the evidence base to inform clinical practice is lacking. These papers focus on (1) diagnosis and treatment during prehospital and in the emergency department, (2) management during the first days of admission, (3) care before and after AHF discharge, and (4) hospitalized AHF management in patients presenting with cardiogenic shock, significant valvular disease, or end-stage renal disease. These papers are not intended to serve as guidelines, but rather to suggest a framework for future recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of AHF. In the current summary paper, we highlight the main considerations and key recommendations in each of the parts of AHF care.	European journal of heart failure	28/09/2025

Perturbations in the intricate interplay of transcriptional effectors within this network can lead to a variety of nervous system pathologies. In this study, we identify Gtf2i-encoded general transcription factor II-I (Tfii-i) as a regulator of key myelination-related genes. Gtf2i deletion from myelinating glial cells in male mice leads to functional alterations in central nervous system (CNS) myelin, including elevated mRNA and protein expression levels of myelin basic protein (Mbp), the central myelin component, enhanced connectivity properties, and thicker myelin wrapping axons with increased diameters. These changes resulted in faster axonal conduction across the corpus callosum (CC), and improved motor coordination. Furthermore, we show that in mature OLs (mOLs), Tfii-i directly binds to regulatory elements of Sox10 and Mbp. In the peripheral nervous system (PNS), Gtf2i deletion from Schwann cells (SCs) leads to hypermyelination of the tibial branch of the sciatic nerve (SN). These findings add to our understanding of myelination regulation and specifically elucidate a cell-autonomous mechanism for Tfii-i in myelinating glia transcriptional network.

To define the DA tumor microenvironment (TME), we performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) on primary DA tumors and matched adjacent normal tissues. This analysis revealed substantial heterogeneity among malignant epithelial cells, including a transcriptionally distinct subset characterized by the upregulation of immune-related genes, which constitutes an immune-associated transcriptional program. Notably, this program included high expression of the chemokine CCL5, which facilitated the recruitment of CCR1(+) macrophages. Using patient-derived DA organoids, we identified malignant cells exhibiting immune-related transcriptional signatures, including elevated CCL5. Functional assays demonstrated that CCL5 promoted CCR1(+) macrophage migration, an effect suppressed by both the CCR1 antagonist BX471 and CCL5-neutralizing antibody. In co-culture, CCL5-expressing DA organoids displayed enhanced survival and proliferation in the presence of CCR1(+) macrophages, while pharmacological blockade of CCR1 significantly increased tumor cell death. Bulk transcriptomic profiling revealed that CCR1 downregulates pro-apoptotic signaling in tumor cells, thereby promoting cell survival and growth. Importantly, combining CCL5/CCR1 inhibitors with standard chemotherapeutic agents resulted in synergistic tumor cell killing. Together, our findings establish the CCL5/CCR1 axis as a key mediator of tumor-macrophage crosstalk in DA, supporting immune evasion and chemoresistance via suppression of macrophage-induced apoptosis. Targeting this axis may represent a promising therapeutic strategy to enhance the efficacy of conventional chemotherapy in DA.	Cancer letters	25/09/2025

Little is known about effectiveness in adolescent girls and young adult women at high risk for HPV-related cancers or after 9-valent HPV vaccine (9vHPV) introduction. OBJECTIVE: To examine effectiveness and herd protection over the first 17 years after HPV vaccine introduction in adolescent girls and young women at increased risk for HPV infection and related cancers. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional study analyzed data from 6 surveillance studies from 2006 to 2023. A consecutive sample of sexually experienced adolescent girls and young women aged 13 to 26 years was recruited from clinical settings. EXPOSURE: Participants were stratified by HPV vaccination status; those who received at least 1 vaccine dose were defined as vaccinated. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Effectiveness and herd protection were assessed by comparing proportions of vaccinated and unvaccinated participants positive for at least 1 type in the 2-valent vaccine (2vHPV), 4-valent vaccine (4vHPV), and 9vHPV in each of 6 studies. The prevalence of vaccine-type HPV was compared in vaccinated participants from surveillance studies 2 through 6 vs participants recruited in surveillance study 1, all of whom were unvaccinated. Inverse probability of treatment weighting with propensity score was used to balance between-wave differences in participant characteristics. RESULTS: Of 2335 participants (mean [SD] age, 18.9 [2.7] years; 1526 African American [65.4%], 13 Asian [0.6%], 6 Native American [0.3%], 582 White [24.9%], and 151 multiracial [6.5%]; 173 Hispanic [7.4%]), 1195 participants (51.2%) reported a sexually transmitted infection history and 1843 participants (78.9%) reported 2 or more male sex partners. Vaccination rates increased from 0 of 371 participants to 330 of 402 participants (82.1%) from 2006 to 2023. Among vaccinated participants, positivity decreased from 93 of 371 participants (27.7%) to 1 of 330 participants (0.4%) for 2vHPV (relative difference, 98.4%), 118 participants (35.4%) to 3 participants (2.1%) for 4vHPV (relative difference, 94.2%), and 163 participants (48.6%) to 21 participants (11.8%) for 9vHPV (relative difference, 75.7%). Among unvaccinated participants, positivity decreased from 93 of 371 participants (25.8%) to 3 of 72 participants (7.3%) for 2vHPV (relative difference, 71.6%), 118 participants (25.3%) to 4 participants (6.1%) for 4vHPV (relative difference, 75.8%), and 163 participants (42.7%) to 13 participants (31.1%) for 9vHPV (relative difference, 27.2%). For positivity rates, counts are raw numbers and percentages are propensity score adjusted. Adjusted logistic regression demonstrated significant reductions in the odds of at least 1 HPV type in the 2vHPV and 4vHPV among all (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 0.03; 95% CI, 0.01 to 0.07 and aOR, 0.06; 95% CI, 0.03 to 0.10, respectively), vaccinated (aOR, 0.01; 95% CI, <0.01 to 0.05 and aOR, 0.04; 95% CI, 0.02 to 0.08, respectively), and unvaccinated (aOR, 0.23; 95% CI, 0.08 to 0.63 and aOR, 0.19; 95% CI, 0.07 to 0.52, respectively) participants and in the 9vHPV among all (aOR, 0.22; 95% CI 0.16 to 0.31) and vaccinated (aOR, 0.14; 95% CI 0.09 to 0.21) participants. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this study, population-level effectiveness and herd protection were robust 17 years after HPV vaccine introduction, even in sexually experienced adolescent girls and young women at relatively high risk for HPV who may not have received the full vaccination series.

10.1111/bph.70209	Oral administration of low-molecular-weight heparin ameliorates colitis by	Zheng D, Chen S, Feng H, Zhang S, Zhang C, Wang Y, Tan W, Qing Q, Liu L, Liu X, Wang Z, Liang L, Sun J, Chen Y	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Previous studies have reported that oral low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) ameliorated colitis by undefined mechanisms in ulcerative colitis (UC) patients. Our study explored the mechanisms of LMWH on colitis from the perspective of gut microbiota and its metabolites. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Dextran sulfate sodium (DSS; 2.5%) was used to induce colitis in mouse model, and LMWH was administered by either oral gavage, intracolonic delivery or subcutaneous injection to compare their therapeutic effects. Pseudo-germ-free mice was established by using antibiotic cocktail, and faecal microbial transplantation (FMT) was performed to verify the role of microbiota in LMWH actions. Alcian blue staining, fluorescence in situ hybridization of EUB338 and immunohistochemical staining were performed to evaluate the integrity of gut mucus barrier. Amplicon sequencing, transcriptome sequencing and untargeted metabolome studies were used to explore LMWH mechanisms. The ameliorating effect of indole-3-propionic acid (IPA) was verified in vitro and in vivo. KEY RESULTS: Oral, but not subcutaneous, administration of LMWH alleviated colitis and enhanced the gut mucus barrier. Pseudo-germ-free mice and FMT assays confirmed that therapeutic effects of oral LMWH were dependent on gut microbiota. Oral LMWH increased Firmicutes abundance and decreased Escherichia/Shigella abundance, subsequently increasing microbial tryptophan metabolites, especially IPA. The protective effects of oral LMWH were reproduced by IPA supplementation, with mucus barrier enhancing through regulating the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: The results provide new insights into the signalling mechanisms associated with the therapeutic potential of LMWH in colitis, and highlight the application of IPA for UC treatment.

These factors may also dynamically influence gut microbiota composition and serum metabolic profiles. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the associations between combined healthy lifestyle and ABOs, and the mediating roles of gut microbiota and serum metabolites. METHODS: This study was conducted based on the Tongji-Huaxi-Shuangliu Birth Cohort (THSBC), comprising 1086 participants with repeated multi-omics data collected at three time points. An independent validation was performed using 161 participants from the Huaxi Birth Cohort (HBC), with available multi-omics data at five time points. Participants were classified into three lifestyle categories (unhealthy, low healthy, and highly healthy) according to diet, physical activity, smoking, drinking, sleep, and body mass index. Gut microbiota were characterized using 16S rRNA gene sequencing in the THSBC and metagenomics in the HBC, while serum metabolites were profiled using untargeted liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Clinical data on birth outcomes, such as gestational age, birth weight, and sex were collected in the THSBC. RESULTS: A highly healthy lifestyle was associated with lower risks of macrosomia (MAC) (odds ratio: 0.43; 95% confidence interval: 0.33, 0.57), preterm birth (PTB) (0.60; 0.46, 0.79), and large for gestational age (LGA) (0.44; 0.35, 0.56). Among the identified mediators, gut microbiota and serum metabolites, including Eisenbergiella, Tyzzerella, Megamonas, pro-Ile, and 1-amino-1-cyclobutane-carboxylic acid were negatively associated with a healthy lifestyle, while Lachnospiraceae NK4A136 group, 4-methoxyestrone, and LPC (0:0/18:3) were positively associated. Mediation analyses showed that Eisenbergiella and 4-methoxyestrone explained 11.4% and 13.0% of the inverse association between a highly healthy lifestyle and PTB, respectively, while the other microbiota and metabolites mediated 5%-7% of the associations with MAC and LGA.

However, the strengths of the commercially available ST platforms in studying spatial biology have not been systematically evaluated using rigorously controlled experiments. We use serial 5 μm sections of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded surgically resected lung adenocarcinoma and pleural mesothelioma samples in tissue microarrays to compare the performance of the ST platforms (CosMx, MERFISH, and Xenium (uni/multi-modal)) in reference to bulk RNA sequencing, multiplex immunofluorescence, GeoMx, and hematoxylin and eosin staining data. In addition to an objective assessment of automatic cell segmentation and phenotyping, we perform a manual phenotyping evaluation to assess pathologically meaningful comparisons between ST platforms. Here, we show the intricate differences between the ST platforms, reveal the importance of parameters such as probe design in determining the data quality, and suggest reliable workflows for accurate spatial profiling and molecular discovery.

10.4291/wjgp.v16.i3.107573	Fatigue in inflammatory bowel disease: Prevalence, risk factors, assessment,	Giri S, Harindranath S, Kulkarni A, Sahoo JK, Joshi H, Nath P, Sahu MK	Fatigue is a prevalent and often debilitating symptom in individuals with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), affecting a substantial proportion of patients, even during periods of disease remission. The prevalence of fatigue in IBD remains high, affecting around half of the IBD patients and being more common in patients with active disease than those in remission. Several risk factors contribute to fatigue in IBD, including active disease and pro-inflammatory state, nutritional deficiencies and anemia, sleep disturbances, psychological comorbidities, microbiota changes and the gut-brain axis, muscle dysfunction, sarcopenia, and physical inactivity. Assessing fatigue in IBD is challenging due to its subjective nature and the lack of a uniformly quantifiable method. Fatigue significantly impacts the quality of life, affecting physical functioning, psychological and emotional well-being, and social and relational consequences. The management of fatigue in IBD requires a comprehensive, multidisciplinary approach. This includes addressing disease activity through conventional drug treatment, biologicals and small molecules, and surgical treatment. Psychological interventions such as cognitive behavioral therapy, problem-solving therapy, solution-focused therapy, mindfulness-based cognitive therapy, and brief behavioral therapy have shown promise in improving fatigue. Nutritional interventions, including treating deficiencies and supplementation, and lifestyle interventions, such as physical exercise, aromatherapy, and sleep interventions, are also important components of fatigue management. Pharmacological interventions like modafinil and bupropion may be considered in refractory cases. This review aims to summarize the current evidence on fatigue in IBD, including its prevalence, risk factors, assessment methods, outcomes, and management strategies.

10.1186/s40001-025-03147-5	Machine learning and nomogram prediction model to explore the relationship	Zou L, Zhao J, Ruan Y, Wang Y	BACKGROUND: Asthma is a prevalent chronic respiratory disease with significant morbidity and healthcare burden. Identifying novel biomarkers for asthma risk prediction is crucial for early intervention and personalized management. The monocyte-to-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio (MHR) has emerged as a potential inflammatory marker in various chronic diseases. This study aimed to investigate the association between MHR and asthma risk using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) and to develop a predictive model for asthma risk incorporating MHR and other clinical variables. METHODS: Data from NHANES (2001-2018) were used. Weighted logistic regression was employed to assess the relationship between MHR and asthma risk. Participants were randomly divided into training (70%) and validation (30%) cohorts. The Boruta algorithm was used to evaluate the training cohort, select the best model, and identify potential confounding factors. A nomogram-based predictive model was constructed using variables selected by the Boruta algorithm [smoke, age, hypertension, cardiovascular disease (CVD), marital status, gender, race, poverty-income ratio (PIR), body mass index (BMI), cancer, education, diabetes, and MHR]. The model's performance was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, calibration curves, and decision curve analysis (DCA) curves. The variables selected by Boruta algorithm are included in the machine learning (ML) model for analysis. SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) analysis was performed to assess the contribution of each variable. RESULTS: A total of 28,855 participants were included after excluding those with missing data. MHR was positively associated with asthma incidence (P < 0.05). The Boruta algorithm achieved an AUC of 0.64 in the validation cohort. Among the ML models, the Xgboost model demonstrated the best performance with an AUC of 0.640 (95% CI 0.623-0.656). SHAP analysis identified CVD as the most influential factor, followed by age, BMI, PIR, and gender. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates a positive association between the MHR and asthma risk, indicating a significant cross-sectional relationship. The nomogram-based predictive model incorporating MHR and other clinical variables showed moderate discriminative ability.	European journal of medical research	26/09/2025
10.1038/s41418-025-01588-3	Epithelial MST1 deficiency promotes pyroptosis and aggravates inflammatory bowel	Lu J, Li F, Wang H, Yu Y, Yuan Y, Zhang Y, Liu P, Zhao Q, Wu M, Ye M	The Hippo pathway has been implicated in the onset and pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), with Mammalian STE20-like kinase 1 (MST1), a core kinase in this pathway, playing significant roles in inflammation and immune regulation. However, the specific role of MST1 in IBD remains largely undefined. In this study, we observed that MST1 expression was significantly decreased in IBD patients and acute colitis mice. Intestinal epithelial cell-specific MST1 knockout mice exhibited heightened susceptibility to dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis, characterized by severe disruption of intestinal epithelial barrier and markedly increased epithelial cell pyroptosis, thus exacerbating intestinal inflammation. Pharmacological inhibition of caspase-1/GSDMD-mediated pyroptosis ameliorated the detrimental effects of MST1 deficiency in colitis. Consistently, MST1 deficiency exacerbated intestinal barrier disruption and pyroptosis in both in vivo and in vitro models under TNFα-induced inflammation and DNA damage. Mechanistically, MST1 depletion promoted YAP nuclear translocation and enhances its interaction with p73 in intestinal epithelial cells, leading to increased p73 stability and transcriptional activity. This, in turn, facilitated the recruitment of p73 to the caspase-1 promoter, upregulating caspase-1 expression and translating into increased pyroptosis under TNFα-induced inflammatory conditions. Altogether, our findings highlight the critical role of MST1 in maintaining intestinal mucosal barrier homeostasis by regulating epithelial cell pyroptosis via the YAP/p73 signaling pathway. Reduced MST1 expression may correlate with a better response to anti-TNF therapy in IBD patients. Consequently, MST1 could serve as a promising predictive biomarker for anti-TNF therapy responsiveness and a potential therapeutic target for IBD, offering valuable insights for personalized treatment strategies.

10.1177/0018720819875376	A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Direct Objective Measures of Situation	Endsley MR	OBJECTIVE: To examine evidence of sensitivity, predictiveness, and methodological concerns regarding direct, objective measures of situation awareness (SA). BACKGROUND: The ability to objectively measure SA is important to the evaluation of user interfaces and displays, training programs, and automation initiatives, as well as for studies that seek to better understand SA in both individuals and teams. A number of methodological criticisms have been raised creating significant confusion in the research field. METHOD: A meta-analysis of 243 studies was conducted to examine evidence of sensitivity and predictiveness, and to address methodological questions regarding Situation Awareness Global Assessment Technique (SAGAT), Situation Present Assessment Technique (SPAM), and their variants. RESULTS: SAGAT and SPAM were found to be equally predictive of performance. SPAM (64%) and real-time probes (73%) were found to have significantly lower sensitivity in comparison to SAGAT (94%). While SAGAT was found not to be overly memory reliant nor intrusive into operator performance, SPAM resulted in problems with intrusiveness in 40% of the studies examined, as well as problems with speed-accuracy tradeoffs, sampling bias, and confounds with workload. Concerns about memory reliance, the utility of these measures for assessing Team SA, and other issues are also addressed. CONCLUSION: SAGAT was found to be a highly sensitive, reliable, and predictive measure of SA that is useful across a wide variety of domains and experimental settings. APPLICATION: Direct, objective SA measurement provides useful and diagnostic insights for research and design in a wide variety of domains and study objectives.	Human factors	01/02/2021

Here, we demonstrate that STK11 links interleukin-4 (IL-4) signaling with metabolic reprogramming to restrain alternatively activated (M2) macrophage polarization. Through integrative transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses, we identified STK11 as a key transcriptional and metabolic regulator during M2 polarization. STK11 deficiency enhanced the expression of M2-associated markers and promoted glutamine metabolism in IL-4-stimulated macrophages. Mechanistically, STK11 deficiency led to increased FOXO1 activation, thereby promoting M2 polarization. Pharmacological inhibition of FOXO1 or glutamine metabolism effectively reversed the enhanced M2 polarization. In an orthotopic model of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, myeloid-specific deletion of STK11 resulted in increased accumulation of M2-like tumor-associated macrophages, impaired antitumor immunity, and accelerated tumor progression. These findings uncover a previously unrecognized role for STK11 in modulating M2 macrophage polarization, offering mechanistic insights that may inform the development of immunometabolic therapies for pancreatic cancer.

Currently, accurate diagnosis for AD relies on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) sampling or a positron emission tomography (PET) scan, methods that cannot be done in primary care centers where most people go with cognitive complaints. This Limitation calls for the urgent need to develop blood-related diagnostic tests that could facilitate early detection and enable timely treatment. Recent CSF proteomic research categorized AD into five molecular subtypes with discrete Genetic risk profiles. Subtypes 1-3, namely neuronal hyperplasticity, innate immune activation, and RNA dysregulation, were characterized by more classical AD-related changes, like accumulation of amyloid/tau and synaptic and immune dysfunction, respectively. On the contrary, non-traditional AD mechanisms in subtypes 4-5 were choroid plexus (CP) dysfunction and blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction, emphasizing clearance deficits in association with brain barrier dysfunction. The unchanged tau levels later may be explained by an alternate disease mechanism (clearance dysfunction). These subtypes included BBB and CP dysfunction. Biomarker identification based on the mechanism of disease progression would increase the precision of diagnoses, allowing for tailored interventions and aiding in the creation of novel therapies for subtypes that might not react favorably to conventional amyloid/tau-targeting strategies. Finding biomarkers specific to each subtype would aid in patient classification, resulting in more individualized therapy as opposed to a ""one-size-fits-all"" strategy. The present review emphasized the importance of identifying blood-based biomarkers (BBMs) related to brain barrier dysfunction from CSF studies and personalized treatment strategies to streamline the diagnostic workup, and may be utilized in standard clinical practice for the early detection of AD."

10.1002/advs.202512360	An Inflammation-Targeting Engineered Probiotic Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 with	Hua S, Li K, Shang P, Liu L, Pan J, Zhu B, Hua Z	The probiotic Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 (EcN), clinically used for ulcerative colitis (UC) due to its safety and genetic tractability, exhibits limited therapeutic efficacy owing to poor targeting and colonization at inflamed sites. Phosphatidylserine (PS) exposure increases on apoptotic colon epithelial cells during UC progression, suggesting PS-targeting could enhance EcN localization. Here, EcN is engineered to surface-display Annexin A5 (ANXA5), a PS-binding protein, to improve inflammation targeting and colonization. Since TNF-α drives UC pathogenesis and anti-TNF-α biologics face cost and safety limitations, the secretion-hindering lpp gene is concurrently knocked out in ANXA5-expressing EcN, creating the inflammation-targeted, secretion-enhanced EcNΔlpp::A5. This base strain is further modified to secrete an anti-TNF-α nanobody (aTN), generating EcNΔlpp::A5-aTN. Both engineered strains demonstrate significantly stronger colonic colonization versus wild-type EcN, effectively attenuating oxidative stress-mediated epithelial apoptosis, restoring mucosal barriers, improving immune-microbiota balance, and alleviating murine colitis. EcNΔlpp::A5-aTN shows superior efficacy to EcNΔlpp::A5. This study develops an engineered EcN system with enhanced targeting, colonization, and secretion. By efficiently delivering anti-TNF-α nanobodies, EcNΔlpp::A5-aTN exhibits strong therapeutic potential for UC, overcoming limitations that hinder the clinical application of wild-type EcN.

In this cross-sectional study, we sought to investigate whether the observed improvement is attributable to the anxiolytic, euphoric, and analgesic properties of alcohol, rather than or in addition to its effect on dystonic movements, as psychiatric symptoms and pain frequently occur in dystonia patients and as emotional stress is a well-established trigger for symptom exacerbation. METHODS: We analyzed data from 339 prospectively enrolled participants with recently diagnosed isolated dystonia (mean age: 55.2 ± 12.5 years, 228 female) of the Natural History Project of the Dystonia Coalition, a large international multicenter study. Alcohol responsiveness was determined by patients´ self-report. Symptoms of depression, as well as generalized and social anxiety, were assessed using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale. Severity of pain was measured using question 21 of the RAND 36-Item Health Survey. RESULTS: Participants with more severe pain reported greater response to alcohol than those with less severe pain (p = .004), whereas symptoms of depression (p = .986), generalized anxiety (p = .395) and social anxiety (p = .953) were not associated. CONCLUSION: Alcohol responsiveness in isolated dystonia is associated with higher levels of pain, whereas self-reported alcohol-related improvements in dystonic movements or tremor do not depend on the euphoric or anxiolytic effects of alcohol. This finding underscores the potential role of pain management in alleviating motor symptoms in dystonia.	Journal of neurology	29/09/2025

However, the precise mechanisms controlling the accumulation of β-catenin protein in CRC cells remain incompletely understood. Here, we show that TRIM24 is elevated in CRC tissues and partially distributed in the cytoplasm. TRIM24 is phosphorylated at serine 1042 by Aurora kinase B (AURKB), which promotes its cytoplasmic distribution. Subsequently, TRIM24 activates Wnt/β-catenin signaling by facilitating AKT activation through interaction with and ubiquitination of its negative regulator von Hippel-Lindau (VHL), resulting in β-catenin accumulation and enhanced proliferation of CRC cells. Moreover, chemical inhibition of AURKB suppresses tumor growth in subcutaneous mouse model and exhibits particular effectiveness against tumors derived from CRC cells characterized by prominent cytoplasmic TRIM24 distribution. Together, these findings reveal a critical role of TRIM24 in CRC cell proliferation, particularly through activating Wnt/β-catenin signaling.	Nature communications	29/09/2025

However, it remains unclear how cells translate oxidative stress signals into adaptive mitophagy responses. Here, we show that mtROS act as signaling molecules that activate the ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM)-cell cycle checkpoint kinase 2 (CHK2), a DNA damage response (DDR) pathway. When activated, CHK2 regulates three critical steps in mitophagy. First, CHK2 phosphorylates mitochondrial membrane protein ATAD3A at Ser371, which inhibits the transport of PINK1 to the inner mitochondrial membrane and leads to the accumulation of PINK1 and the commencement of mitophagy. Second, activated CHK2 targets the autophagy adaptor OPTN at Ser177 and Ser473, thereby enhancing the targeting of ubiquitinated mitochondria to autophagosomes. Finally, CHK2 phosphorylates Beclin 1 at Ser90 and Ser93, hence promoting the formation of autophagosomal membranes. Consistent with these effects, Chk2(-/-) mice show impaired mitophagic induction and impaired recovery in a ROS-dependent model of renal ischemia-reperfusion. Our study reveals a mtROS-triggered adaptive pathway that coordinates mitophagic induction, in order to protect cells and tissues exposed to pathophysiological stress-induced damage.

10.1136/bmj-2024-083182	Use of new CORE risk score to predict 10 year risk of liver cirrhosis in general	Strandberg R, Åberg F, Asteljoki JV, Luukkonen PK, Salomaa V, Jula A, Lundqvist A, Männistö S, Perola M, Talbäck M, Hammar N, Hagström H	OBJECTIVE: To develop and validate a novel risk prediction model for incident major adverse liver outcomes (MALO) in a primary care setting. DESIGN: Population based cohort study. SETTING: Sweden, with validation in Finland and the UK. PARTICIPANTS: Model development in 480 651 individuals with no known history of liver disease and blood tests taken in primary care or at occupational healthcare screenings; validation in two cohorts with 24 191 and 449 806 individuals without known history of liver disease. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: 10 year risk of a composite outcome of compensated and decompensated cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, liver transplant, and liver related mortality, collectively referred to as MALO. RESULTS: A new risk model was created using flexible parametric survival models and several easily available laboratory based biomarkers. The model includes age, sex, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and γ-glutamyl transferase. The model's performance was assessed in terms of discrimination (time dependent area under the curve), calibration (calibration curves), and clinical utility (decision curve analysis). External validation was done using data from the UK Biobank and the FINRISK and Health 2000 cohorts and compared with the FIB-4 score. The median follow-up time was 28 years, and 7168 MALO events were observed in that time. The incident risk of MALO at 10 years was 0.27%. The new risk score, termed CORE (Cirrhosis Outcome Risk Estimator), achieved a 10 year area under the curve of 88% (95% confidence interval 87% to 89%) compared with 79% (78% to 80%) for FIB-4. The calibration of CORE was good in all three cohorts, and according to the decision curve analysis CORE provides a higher net benefit than FIB-4 for all risk thresholds. CONCLUSIONS: The CORE model, based on a flexible modelling approach and using biomarkers easily accessible in primary care, outperforms FIB-4 when predicting liver related outcomes in the general population and could be a novel means to stratify patients at risk for liver disease in the general population.

10.1016/j.disamonth.2025.102012	Multiple sclerosis updates and the safety and efficacy of Bruton tyrosine kinase	Prajjwal P, Patel PV, Patel ZV, Inban P, Patel D, Mahato P, Shamim L, Godinho NJS, Tekuru Y	BACKGROUND: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic neurodegenerative and autoimmune disease characterized by CNS inflammation and demyelination. Although current disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) can reduce peripheral immune responses, their impact on CNS-compartmentalized inflammation remains limited. Bruton Tyrosine Kinase inhibitors (BTKis) have emerged as promising oral agents targeting both B cells and microglia. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety profiles and effectiveness of two BTK inhibitors- Tolebrutinib and Evobrutinib in the management of relapsing multiple sclerosis. METHODS: A literature search was conducted using PubMed, Embase, and Scopus for randomized controlled trials published between 2020 and 2024. Studies comparing Evobrutinib and Tolebrutinib in MS patients were screened and evaluated based on predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Four relevant RCTs were matched and examined in more detail. RESULTS: On MRI, both BTK inhibitors showed decreases in gadolinium-enhancing lesions; Tolebrutinib demonstrated dose-dependent efficacy in reducing new Gd-enhancing lesions and T2 lesion counts, with optimal effects at 60 mg daily. Evobrutinib showed dose-dependent decreases in serum neurofilament light (NfL) levels and relapse rates, with twice-daily dosing providing greater BTK inhibition and clinical benefit. Nasopharyngitis, temporary increases in liver enzymes, and mild gastrointestinal symptoms were among the frequent side effects for both agents. The included studies did not report any direct clinical comparisons of CNS penetration or microglial modulation. CONCLUSION: With good safety and efficacy profiles in treating relapsing multiple sclerosis, both of the BTKis (Evobrutinib and Tolebrutinib) show promise. Both have promise as oral treatments of the future, but Tolebrutinib might have better effects on the central nervous system. To confirm long-term results and determine their role in progressive MS, more phase III trials are necessary.	Disease-a-month : DM	26/09/2025
10.3390/nu17182984	Microbiota Gut-Brain Axis and Autism Spectrum Disorder: Mechanisms and	Petropoulos A, Stavropoulou E, Tsigalou C, Bezirtzoglou E	"Background/Objectives: Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental condition often accompanied by gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms and gut microbiota imbalances. The microbiota-gut-brain (MGB) axis is a bidirectional communication network linking gut microbes, the GI system, and the central nervous system (CNS). This narrative review explores the role of the MGB axis in ASD pathophysiology, focusing on communication pathways, neurodevelopmental implications, gut microbiota alteration, GI dysfunction, and emerging therapeutics. Methods: A narrative review methodology was employed. We searched major scientific databases including PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar for research on MGB axis mechanisms, gut microbiota composition in ASD, dysbiosis, leaky gut, immune activation, GI disorders, and intervention (probiotics, prebiotics, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), antibiotics and diet). Key findings from recent human, animal and in vitro studies were synthesized thematically, emphasizing mechanistic insights and therapeutic outcomes. Original references from the initial manuscript draft were retained and supplemented for comprehensiveness and accuracy. Results: The MGB axis involves neuroanatomical, neuroendocrine, immunological, and metabolic pathways that enable microbes to influence brain development and function. Individuals with ASD commonly exhibit gut dysbiosis characterized by reduced microbial diversity (notably lower Bifidobacterium and Firmicutes) and overpresentation of potentially pathogenic taxa (e.g., Clostridia, Desulfovibrio, Enterobacteriaceae). Dysbiosis is associated with increased intestinal permeability (""leaky gut"") and newly activated and altered microbial metabolite profiles, such as short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and lipopolysaccharides (LPSs). Functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) are prevalent in ASD, linking gut-brain axis dysfunction to behavioral severity. Therapeutically, probiotics and prebiotics can restore eubiosis, fortify the gut barrier, and reduce neuroinflammation, showing modest improvements in GI and behavioral symptoms. FMT and Microbiota Transfer Therapy (MTT) have yielded promising results in open label trials, improving GI function and some ASD behaviors. Antibiotic interventions (e.g., vancomycin) have been found to temporarily alleviate ASD symptoms associated with Clostridiales overgrowth, while nutritional strategies (high-fiber, gluten-free, or ketogenic diets) may modulate the microbiome and influence outcomes. Conclusions: Accumulating evidence implicates the MGB axis in ASD pathogenesis. Gut microbiota dysbiosis and the related GI pathology may exacerbate neurodevelopmental and behavioral symptoms via immune, endocrine and neural routes. Interventions targeting the gut ecosystem, through diet modification, probiotics, symbiotics, or microbiota transplants, offer therapeutic promise. However, heterogeneity in findings underscores the need for rigorous, large-scale studies to clarify causal relationships and evaluate long-term efficacy and safety. Understanding MGB axis mechanisms in ASD could pave the way for novel adjunctive treatments to improve the quality of life for individuals with ASD."	Nutrients	17/09/2025

However, this association has largely been unexplored among the Asian population, generally, and the Taiwanese population, specifically. METHODS: In our study, 950 study pairs (children with ADHD [ICD-9-CM code: 314] and their mothers) and 3,800 control pairs (children without ADHD and their mothers) matched by demographic characteristics were identified between 1998 and 2008 from the Taiwan Longitudinal Health Insurance Database. Maternal use of acetaminophen was assessed in the first trimester, second trimester, and third trimester of pregnancy and over the period from 3 months before pregnancy to the date of last menstrual cycle. RESULTS: Logistic regression analysis with adjustments for demographic data, gestational infections, comorbid perinatal conditions, and maternal mental health disorders indicated that exposure to acetaminophen in the second trimester (odds ratio [OR] = 1.19; 95% CI, 1.00-1.40), both the first and second trimesters (OR = 1.28; 95% CI, 1.00-1.64), or in any trimester (OR = 1.20; 95% CI, 1.01-1.42) was associated with an increased risk of ADHD in offspring. Sensitivity analysis excluding gestational infections and maternal mental health disorders confirmed this association (OR = 1.33; 95% CI, 1.04-1.69). CONCLUSION: Prenatal exposure to acetaminophen was associated with an increased risk of ADHD in offspring, regardless of gestational infections and maternal mental health disorders. Additional studies are necessary to clarify the underlying mechanisms by which prenatal exposure to acetaminophen leads to neurodevelopmental risks.	The Journal of clinical psychiatry	10/09/2019

Despite significant advances, the management of DME remains a dynamic field with many unresolved controversies. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) allows objective assessment, however, correlation between vision and morphological changes can be inconsistent, causing disagreements on treatment strategies. DME is a complex disease with multifactorial pathophysiological pathways, leading to heterogenous treatment responses. There is a lack of standardized definition of treatment 'non-response"" and protocol for switching to second-line or adjuvant treatments. New anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) drugs and multi-targeted therapies seem to demonstrate improved durability, but long-term data is not yet available.

Significant vision loss from DME in pregnant women, young children and elderly patients with systemic comorbidities are challenging conundrums. An international panel of experts (IPE) comprising 36 experts from 16 countries formulated and voted on the consensus statements in 5 key areas: 1) Diagnostic controversies around classification and imaging; 2) Treatment controversies; 3) Management paradigm between protocol-based and individualized approaches; 4) Emerging controversies in novel therapeutics and AI application, and 5) Special considerations for specific patient populations.

The article provides an in-depth discussion of key metabolic pathways on which tumors depend (such as glucose metabolism), epigenetic regulation (e.g., lactylation), and multi-layered stress defense mechanisms-including autophagy, redox homeostasis, anti-ferroptosis, and cuproptosis-while dissecting their inherent vulnerabilities. Furthermore, it emphasizes the tripartite crosstalk among neural, immune, and metabolic components within the TME, systematically explaining how neural signals, immunometabolic reprogramming, and key metabolites collectively regulate tumorigenesis, along with a commentary on the role of microbiota in the TME. Based on these mechanisms, we summarize several emerging targets with clinical translational potential, providing clear directions for future research. Strategies such as combination therapies and dietary interventions are also considered highly promising. Despite ongoing challenges such as metabolic heterogeneity, the deepening integration of multidisciplinary approaches and advances in AI-driven multi-omics analyses are paving the way for transformative prospects in cancer therapy."

10.1016/j.phymed.2025.157318	Liuwei Dihuang formula ameliorates perimenopausal atherosclerosis by modulating	Zhang S, Feng H, Jiang J, Feng S, Jiang Y, Chen G, Wu Y, Liu R, Ma Y, Ma Y, Li Y, Bian H, Meng Q, Zhu R	BACKGROUND: Trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), a product of the gut microbiota, is essential to the pathophysiology of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Although Liuwei Dihuang Formula (LWDH) can ameliorate perimenopausal atherosclerosis (AS) and modulate gut microbes, it is unknown how it regulates the trimethylamine (TMA)-TMAO pathway. PURPOSE: This study aimed to examine whether LWDH could attenuates perimenopausal AS by modulating the gut microbiota-TMA-TMAO axis and to clarify the associated mechanisms, with an emphasis on its possible synergistic interaction with the probiotic Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. Lactis (B.lactis). METHODS: In ApoE knockout (ApoE(-/-)) mice, a perimenopausal AS model was established via bilateral ovariectomy combined with a high-fat diet (HFD), followed by LWDH intervention. The TMAO and TMA levels in plasma and the liver were measured using targeted metabolomics. Microbial communities were analyzed using 16S rRNA sequencing. In vitro microbial culture experiments were carried out to validate the LWDH effect on the key bacterial populations and metabolic pathways. A combined intervention with LWDH and B.lactis was also performed to evaluate the potential synergistic effects. RESULTS: LWDH significantly reduced aortic plaque burden and decreased plasma and hepatic TMAO levels in perimenopausal AS mice. Mechanistic analyses revealed that LWDH remodeled the gut microbiota, suppressed TMA-producing bacteria, and enhanced TMA degradation, thereby reducing systemic TMAO accumulation. Notably, 16S rRNA sequencing revealed a close link between decreased Bifidobacterium abundance and elevated TMAO levels. In vitro assays confirmed that LWDH enhanced the TMA-degrading activity of B. lactis and downregulated the cutC gene in Escherichia coli, resulting in reduced TMA synthesis. Combined LWDH and B.lactis intervention led to greater reductions in plasma TMAO compared to B. lactis alone, accompanied by improved lipid metabolism and attenuation of systemic inflammation. CONCLUSION: These findings are the first to show that LWDH mitigated perimenopausal AS progression by modulating the gut microbiota-dependent TMA-TMAO axis. The dual mechanisms of enhancing TMA degradation and inhibiting TMA production, together with the synergistic effects of LWDH and B. lactis, highlight a novel therapeutic strategy that integrates traditional Chinese medicine and probiotics for AS management.

10.1016/j.arr.2025.102902	Sirtuins in Parkinson's Disease: Molecular Mechanisms and Pathophysiological	Li X, Luo X, Cao X, Thomas ER, Wang W, Zhou X, Zhou S, Wu A, Gao R, Liu K, Wu J	Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that is associated with mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and abnormal protein aggregation. The silent information regulator 2 (Sir2) family of proteins, known as sirtuins (SIRT1 - SIRT7), are nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD(+))-dependent histone deacetylases that regulate important signal transduction pathways in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. An increasing number of studies revealed that sirtuins play diverse roles in cellular homeostasis, such as metabolic regulation, oxidative stress response, apoptosis, organelle protection, and gene stability. Intriguingly, growing evidence suggests that sirtuins may serve as pivotal molecular mediators in PD, yet a comprehensive synthesis of their roles in this disorder is lacking. Although the precise pathogenesis of PD remains unmapped, identifying common molecular nodes could offer effective therapeutic strategies. In this review, we present the first systematic integration of current knowledge on the distinct contributions of individual sirtuins to PD pathophysiology offering promising molecular targets for the treatment of PD. Unlike previous studies focusing on isolated aspects of sirtuin biology, our work uniquely consolidates the multifaceted mechanisms by which sirtuins modulate PD, offering a holistic perspective on their therapeutic potential. We underscore the transformative potential of sirtuin modulation, positioning a promising and unexplored frontier in neurodegenerative disease therapy. This work aims to provide new insights into potential sirtuin-targeted therapy of PD.	Ageing research reviews	26/09/2025

Blood vessels are susceptible to vascular calcification(VC) in patients with maintenance hemodialysis, which is linked to mortality. Arteriovenous fistulas as frequently used hemodialysis access suffer from mechanical stress, often developing VC, which impairs hemodialysis quality. Piezo1, as a mechanosensitive ion channel receptor in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), is essential for the sensing and transduction of mechanical stress. However, whether and how mechanical stress accelerates VC by Piezo1 is unclear. Here we observed, Radial arteries with VC from patients with maintenance hemodialysis showed higher Piezo1 expression. In vitro, VSMCs under high phosphorus or high hydrostatic pressure (HP) showed more expression of Piezo1, and calcification, including higher calcium deposition and osteogenic differentiation. Activating Piezo1 by Yoda1 showed significant calcification. Inhibition of Piezo1 by GsMTx4 or silence of Piezo1 inhibited HP-induced calcification. Similar results were obtained from rat aortas in vitro. Inhibition of BMP2 by Noggin alleviated HP-induced or Yoda1-induced calcification. Endoplasmic reticulum stress and calcium ion influx were activated in VSMCs under HP by Piezo1. Collectively, our results suggest mechanical stress accelerates VC by Piezo1/BMP2 of VSMCs.

10.1186/s12931-025-03356-w	Toward precision medicine in COPD: phenotypes, endotypes, biomarkers, and	Xie C, Wang K, Yang K, Zhong Y, Gul A, Luo W, Yalikun M, He J, Chen W, Xu W, Dong J	"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a heterogeneous disorder characterized by diverse clinical manifestations, pathophysiological mechanisms, and therapeutic responses. This review explores the evolving landscape of precision medicine in COPD management, with particular emphasis on optimizing patient care through the integration of phenotypes, endotypes, biomarkers, and treatable traits. Phenotypic classification based on observable clinical and radiographic features has facilitated the identification of distinct subgroups such as ""emphysema-dominant"" or ""frequent-exacerbator"" subtypes. Emerging research, however, increasingly emphasizes endotypes-disease subcategories defined by unique biological mechanisms including neutrophilic inflammation, eosinophilic airway involvement, or α(1) antitrypsin deficiency-which may demonstrate superior predictive value for therapeutic responses. Biomarkers encompassing blood eosinophil counts, serum C-reactive protein, and sputum transcriptomics are progressively being implemented for patient stratification and guidance of targeted therapies, including inhaled corticosteroids or biologics. Furthermore, the ""treatable traits"" framework enhances personalized management by addressing modifiable factors beyond airflow limitation, such as comorbidities, psychosocial determinants, and exacerbation triggers. Despite these advancements, persistent challenges remain in biomarker validation, standardization of phenotypic definitions, and clinical translation of research findings. Future directions involve early detection of pre-COPD states and treatable traits, integration of multi-omics data, machine learning-driven dynamic phenotyping, and pragmatic clinical trials evaluating precision-guided interventions. By aligning pathobiological mechanisms with targeted therapies, precision medicine holds promise for transforming COPD care from reactive management to proactive, individualized therapeutic paradigms."

10.1016/j.ebiom.2025.105945	Peripheral blood neutrophil proteomic profiling with transcriptomic data	Yang J, Lv Z, Liu L, Zhang H, Hu J, Geng X, Xin H, Liu Z, Gao L, Zhang X, Xu Y, Liu R, Jin Q, Zheng J	BACKGROUND: Tuberculosis (TB) is one of the deadliest infectious diseases worldwide, causing millions of new cases and deaths annually. Rapid and accurate TB diagnostics are essential for TB control, yet current methods do not fully meet global needs. Peripheral blood neutrophils play a critical role in TB infection and represent a promising source of diagnostic markers. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional proteomic analysis to characterise neutrophil protein profiles in individuals with active TB (ATB), latent TB infection (LTBI), and healthy controls (HC). Stringent criteria were applied to identify differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) among these groups. Transcriptomic data were integrated to perform pathway enrichment analysis of DEPs. Three DEPs (B2M, TXN, and PRDX5) were further validated as candidate diagnostic biomarkers for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) infection using automated western blotting in a cohort of 319 individuals, including 71 ATB, 142 LTBI, and 106 HC. FINDINGS: Hundreds of DEPs were identified across the three groups. Integrated transcriptomic analysis revealed significant enrichment of DEPs in the NOD-like receptor signalling pathway. Receiver operating characteristic analysis of the three-protein combination (B2M, TXN, and PRDX5) yielded an area under the curve of 0.9847, with a sensitivity of 95.11% and a specificity of 96.23% for detecting MTB infection. INTERPRETATION: This study presents a comprehensive proteomic profile of neutrophils under different MTB infection states, and this three-protein combination may assist in the diagnosis of MTB infection. FUNDING: This work was supported by the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences (CAMS) Innovation Fund for Medical Sciences (2021-I2M-1-037) and the National Science and Technology Major Project of China (20212017ZX10201301-002-003).

10.1038/s41556-025-01764-0	Remote control of AMPK via extracellular adenosine controls tissue growth.	Zhang Y, Strassburger K, Teleman AA	Adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a regulator of cellular catabolism that is activated by AMP. As AMP accumulates in cells with low ATP, AMPK is considered a stress-activated kinase. While studying organ growth during Drosophila development, we find that AMPK can also be activated by a signalling metabolite not related to stress. Specifically, we find that two physiological inputs known to regulate organ growth rates (ecdysone (a steroid hormone) and dietary protein) modulate expression of adenosine deaminase in the intestine. This, in turn, alters circulating adenosine levels. Circulating adenosine acts as a signalling molecule by entering cells, becoming phosphorylated to AMP and activating AMPK to inhibit organ growth. Thus, AMPK activity is regulated developmentally, and AMPK activity in one tissue can be remote controlled by another tissue via circulating adenosine. Notably, this mechanism accounts for half the effect of dietary protein on tissue growth rates in Drosophila.	Nature cell biology	26/09/2025
10.3390/biom15091284	The Impact of Glucagon-like Peptide-1 Receptor Agonists on Erectile Function:	Kounatidis D, Vallianou NG, Rebelos E, Vallianou K, Diakoumopoulou E, Makrilakis K, Tentolouris N	Erectile dysfunction (ED) is a common yet frequently underrecognized microvascular complication of diabetes, affecting up to three out of four individuals. Key contributing factors include advancing age, long-standing disease duration, and suboptimal glycemic control, as well as insulin resistance and androgen deficiency-the latter being particularly common in men with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and obesity. While numerous studies have investigated the effects of various antidiabetic therapies on diabetes-related ED, the results remain inconsistent, limiting definitive conclusions. In recent years, increasing attention has focused on a novel class of antidiabetic medications, namely glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs). These agents have become central to the treatment of T2D due to their potent glucose-lowering properties and well-documented benefits on cardiovascular outcomes, and weight loss. Given these pleiotropic effects, GLP-1 RAs have been presumed to positively influence erectile function-a hypothesis supported by a growing body of experimental and clinical research. However, preliminary reports have also raised concerns about a possible association between GLP-1 RA use and ED. This narrative review aims to synthesize current evidence regarding the impact of GLP-1 RAs on erectile function, providing a platform for future research in this evolving field.

10.1186/s13024-025-00877-2	Autophagic impairment in sleep-wake circuitry is linked to sleep loss at the	Morrone CD, Tsang AA, Yu WH	BACKGROUND: Proteostasis, in particular the impairment of autophagic activity, is linked to sleep dysregulation and is an early sign of dementias including Alzheimer's disease (AD). This coupling of events may be a critical alteration driving proteinopathy and AD progression. In the present study, we investigated sleep-wake and memory regulating neurons for vulnerability to autophagic impediment, and related these findings to progression of the sleep and cognitive phenotype.  METHODS: Using the double knock-in AD mouse model, App(NL-G-F)xMAPT, we examined phenotypic and pathological alterations at several timepoints and compared to age-matched single knock-in MAPT mice. Spatial learning, memory and executive Function were investigated in the Barnes maze. Sleep was investigated by 24-h locomotor activity and EEG. Immunostaining for autophagic, neuronal and pathological markers was conducted in brain regions related to memory (hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, entorhinal cortex) and the sleep-wake cycle (hypothalamus, locus coeruleus). Hippocampal electrophysiological recordings were conducted to probe neuronal Function during object investigation. A 3-day sleep disruption was conducted in MAPT mice to investigate autophagic changes following sleep loss. Autophagy was activated in MAPT mice with trehalose to probe effects on sleep recovery. RESULTS: We identified that disrupted sleep occurred from early-stages in App(NL-G-F)xMAPT mice, that sleep declined over age, and sleep deficits preceded cognitive impairments in late-stages. Cytoplasmic autophagic impediment in hypothalamic and locus coeruleus sleep-wake neurons occurred in early-stage App(NL-G-F)xMAPT mice, prior to significant β-amyloid deposition in these regions, with a failure of lysosomal flux over disease progression. Autophagic changes in the hippocampus and cortex at early-stage were predominantly in processes and less frequently associated with the lysosome. Plaque-associated autophagic and lysosomal accumulations were frequent from the early-stage. Sex differences in the AD phenotype were prominent, including greater cognitive decline in males than females, linked to increased proteostasis burden in EC layer II neurons and hippocampal tau in the late-stage. Conversely, sleep impairments were more rapid in females including less REM sleep recovery than males, along with greater autophagic burden in hippocampal processes of female App(NL-G-F)xMAPT mice. We probed the sleep-cognition linkage demonstrating hippocampal electrophysiological slowing during cognitive processing in mid-stage App(NL-G-F)xMAPT mice, prior to cognitive decline. We provide evidence for a positive feedback loop in the autophagic-sleep relationship by demonstrating that disrupted sleep in MAPT mice led to arrhythmic sleep patterns and accumulations of autophagic aggregates in the hippocampus and hypothalamus, similar to as was seen in the early Alzheimer's phenotype. We further probed the autophagy-sleep linkage by treating MAPT mice with trehalose to activate autophagy and demonstrate an improvement in sleep recovery following a sleep disruption. CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate the vulnerability of sleep-regulating neurons to proteostatic dysfunction and the sleep-autophagy linkage as an early, and treatable, Alzheimer's disease mechanism.

Astrocytes play key roles in AD pathogenesis. Natural products show promise for treating AD through modulating amyloid-beta (Aβ) and tau pathology, inhibiting neuroinflammation and oxidative stress, and protecting cellular organelles. Preclinical evidence supports their efficacy in targeting astrocyte-related mechanisms, enhancing cognition, and reducing neuronal damage. PURPOSE: Systematically summarize and evaluate the medicinal benefits of plant-derived natural products in modulating astrocyte-mediated processes to attenuate AD progression. METHODS: A comprehensive literature review was performed in PubMed and Web of Science, utilizing targeted keywords such as ""natural products"", ""active compounds"", ""Alzheimer's disease"", and ""astrocytes"". The review primarily focused on studies published between 2013 and 2024, with the selected literature systematically categorized and analyzed. RESULTS: This review highlights the medicinal benefits of plant-derived natural products, such as flavonoids, alkaloids, polyphenols, and terpenes in targeting astrocyte morphology and function to combat AD. These bioactive compounds modulate key pathological processes, including neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, Aβ metabolism, tau hyperphosphorylation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and ER stress, outlining pathways to alleviate AD through astrocytic effects. The review also summarizes clinical progress and major challenges in translating these compounds, such as variability, low bioavailability, and delivery limitations. CONCLUSION: This study addresses a critical gap by systematically elucidating the relationship between astrocytes and AD, and therapeutic potential of plant-derived natural products. It aims to expand treatment options for patients and advance the development of therapeutic strategies in the field of AD management."

10.1007/s10142-025-01712-z	Cancer gene therapy: historical perspectives, current applications, and future	Zeng J, Luo J, Zeng Y	Gene therapy has emerged as a transformative approach in cancer treatment, leveraging genetic modifications to target malignancies with enhanced precision. Early efforts faced challenges such as inefficient vector delivery (< 5% tumor transduction rates with first-generation adenoviruses), immune responses (neutralizing antibodies in ~ 30% of patients), and limited clinical efficacy (< 10% objective response rates in 1990s trials). However, advancements in viral and non-viral vectors (e.g., AAVs achieving > 50% transduction efficiency in solid tumors), alongside CRISPR-Cas9 (90% target gene knockout rates in preclinical models) and RNA interference technologies, have revolutionized the field. Presently, gene therapy strategies, including tumor suppressor gene restoration, oncogene silencing, and immune modulation, demonstrate promising clinical outcomes. Despite persistent hurdles like off-target effects and high costs, emerging innovations in personalized gene editing, oncolytic viruses, and combination therapies signal a paradigm shift in oncology. This review explores the evolution of gene therapy for cancer, highlighting key milestones, current applications, and future directions that could unlock its full therapeutic potential.

METHODS: Utilizing data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) spanning the years 2005-2018, a total of 19,867 adults (aged ≥ 20 years) were examined. Eight anthropometric indexes were calculated. Clinical OA was assessed through participants' self-reported responses by questionnaires. Multivariable logistic regression analysis and secondary analysis such as restricted cubic splines (RCS), receiver operating characteristic (ROC), decision curve analysis (DCA) and the area under the curve (AUC) analysis were employed to investigate the associations between anthropometric indexes and clinical OA. RESULTS: The average age of the participants was 46.94 and 49.98% were female. Multivariable logistic regression analysis demonstrated significant associations between all indexes and clinical OA, especially BMI (per 1 standard deviation [SD], odd ration [OR] [95% Confidence interval [CI]] = 1.52[1.40, 1.66]), WTI (OR [95%CI] = 1.50[1.36, 1.65]) and WHtR (OR [95%CI] = 1.50[1.36, 1.64]). Latent profile analysis showed higher indexes could increase clinical OA risk. Additionally, AUC of WWI was the highest, at 0.6724, and DCA indicated that net profit of WWI was higher than other indexes when threshold was below 25%. The results of subgroup analysis proved the robustness of the findings in different sub-populations. CONCLUSION: Eight anthropometric indexes related to obesity were all significantly positively associated with clinical OA. Particularly, non-hematological indexes such as WWI and WHtR may show better efficacy in predicting and interventions for clinical OA outcomes, indicating their potential as the preferred strategy for early detection and management of clinical OA.

Until now, China had experienced only sporadic outbreaks linked to imported cases. METHODS: We analyzed epidemiological, clinical, and public health data from the ongoing 2025 Guangdong outbreak, the largest chikungunya epidemic recorded in China. RESULTS: The outbreak began in Foshan on July 8, 2025, with over 3,000 confirmed cases in the first two weeks and more than 10,000 by late August. Clinical presentations were typical of chikungunya fever, including acute fever, arthralgia, and rash, with no severe complications or deaths. Local and interregional spread included travel-associated cases in Macao, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Guangxi. Authorities implemented expanded PCR testing, isolation of cases in mosquito-proof facilities, and comprehensive vector control. Clinical management remains supportive, with no licensed antivirals. CONCLUSION: The unprecedented scale and rapid spread of CHIKV in Guangdong underscore the role of ecological and mobility factors in transforming local introductions into large epidemics. Strengthened surveillance, genomic analysis, regional data sharing, and vaccine preparedness will be critical to curb future arbovirus threats in China.

In treatment-refractory SLE, we show that peripheral CD19(⁺) B cells and bone marrow CD19⁻BCMA⁺ long-lived plasma cells are dominant autoantibody sources, motivating dual CD19 and BCMA targeting. Here we report results from a cohort of patients (14 female, one male) in an ongoing phase 1 dose-escalation trial of co-infused autologous anti-CD19 and anti-BCMA chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells after fludarabine/cyclophosphamide lymphodepletion. Primary endpoints were dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) within 28 days and adverse events within 12 weeks; key secondary endpoints comprised attainment of Lupus Low Disease Activity State (LLDAS) and DORIS remission within 12 weeks and in vivo CAR-T persistence within 24 weeks. Exploratory endpoints were the duration of post-infusion B cell depletion and time to recovery, the kinetics of immune reconstitution and longitudinal changes in autoantibody titers and serum immunoglobulin concentrations after CAR-T therapy. Over a median 712-day follow-up (range, 613-1,134), no DLTs occurred. Grade 1 cytokine release syndrome developed in 86.7% of patients, with no neurotoxicity or treatment-related deaths. The most common grade 3 or higher adverse events were neutropenia (100%), thrombocytopenia (40%) and anemia (13.3%), all of which were reversible with supportive care. By week 12, 12 of 15 patients (80%) fulfilled both the LLDAS and DORIS remission criteria. Multiomic analyses confirmed elimination of autoreactive CD19⁺BCMA⁺ clones, reconstitution of naive IgM/IgD B cells and durable downregulation of interferon-stimulated and BAFF-dependent signatures, indicating improved immune homeostasis. Longitudinal monitoring of three patients for 1 year demonstrated sustained eradication of pathogenic clones, suggesting potential cure. Dual anti-CD19/anti-BCMA CAR-T cell therapy demonstrates good safety and promising clinical efficacy in treatment-refractory SLE. This study supports the further development of this treatment approach for patients with rSLE. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT05030779 .	Nature medicine	24/09/2025

Many patients are resistant to current antidepressant therapies, underscoring the need for novel treatments targeting underlying mechanisms. We previously discovered that glutaminase (GLS1), an enzyme converting glutamine to glutamate, is upregulated specifically in activated microglia in mice exposed to Chronic Social Defeat Stress (CSDS). Importantly, GLS1 mRNA was also upregulated in microglia within postmortem brain tissue of MDD patients, highlighting a potential role for microglial GLS1 in MDD pathophysiology. However, existing GLS1 inhibitors lack brain penetrance and/or cause gastrointestinal toxicities, limiting their translational potential. To address this, we utilized a hydroxyl-terminated poly(amidoamine) dendrimer nanoparticle system to selectively target microglial GLS1. Using structurally distinct GLS1 inhibitors, we synthesized two hydroxyl-dendrimer-GLS1 inhibitor conjugates: dendrimer-TTM020 (D-TTM020) and dendrimer-JHU29 (D-JHU29). In the murine CSDS model, we evaluated their microglial target engagement, safety, and efficacy using immunofluorescence, GLS1 activity assays, gastrointestinal histopathology, and a battery of behavioral tests. Using a Cy5 fluorescently labeled hydroxyl-dendrimer (D-Cy5), we confirmed that systemically administered D-Cy5 crossed the blood-brain barrier and was selectively engulfed by activated microglia in mice after CSDS. D-TTM020 and D-JHU29 attenuated CSDS-induced microglial GLS1 activity elevation without affecting non-microglial cells. Furthermore, D-TTM020 and D-JHU29 both alleviated	Neurotherapeutics : the journal of the American Society for Experimental	26/09/2025

Apalutamide (APA) and darolutamide (DARO) have been shown to improve metastasis-free survival (MFS). This study evaluated the real-world efficacy and safety of APA and DARO in Japanese patients with nmCRPC. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 67 nmCRPC patients treated with APA (n = 32) or DARO (n = 35). Outcomes included time to treatment discontinuation or mCRPC progression, time to mCRPC, PSA response rate, treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs), post-mCRPC treatment patterns, and predictors of progression. RESULTS: In patients with prostate-specific antigen doubling time (PSADT) < 10 months, no significant difference was observed between the APA and DARO groups in the time to progression to mCRPC. PSA response and MFS were comparable between groups. TRAEs were significantly more frequent with APA (75.0% vs. 25.7%), with rash being the most common. High PSA at treatment initiation (≥ 3.6 ng/mL) and PSA response < 90% were independent predictors of progression. Abiraterone was the most common first-line agent after mCRPC. CONCLUSIONS: DARO was associated with a lower incidence of TRAEs compared to APA. Rash was more prevalent with APA. Elevated baseline PSA and suboptimal PSA response were associated with progression.

10.1186/s12951-025-03698-z	Injectable responsive hydrogel with synergistic antibacterial and	Li X, Zhang Z, Yang X, Yu M, Tang Y, Wei J, Li Z, Hai J, Zhang B	Periodontitis is a chronic inflammatory disease driven by dysbiotic microbial biofilms and localized reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation, with inflammation management made challenging by recurrent infections from residual pathogenic bacteria in the periodontal pockets. To address this, we engineered an injectable pH-responsive hydrogel (MH@ZIF-8/CS/β-GP) through the integration of minocycline hydrochloride (MH)-encapsulated zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8) nanoparticles into a chitosan (CS) and β-glycerophosphate (β-GP) crosslinked matrix. The MH@ZIF-8 displayed broad-spectrum antimicrobial efficacy against key periodontal pathogens including Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg), and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (Aa), primarily attributed to the synergistic antimicrobial effects of Zn ions and MH. Additionally, MH@ZIF-8 effectively eliminated ROS by inhibiting the NLRP3/Caspase-1/IL-1β signaling pathway, demonstrating potent anti-inflammatory effect in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated RAW264.7 cells. The MH@ZIF-8/CS/β-GP hydrogel, which exhibited favored cytocompatibility with human gingival fibroblasts (HGFs), undergoed a rapid sol-gel transition and pH-responsive sustained-release drug delivery under the acidic conditions of periodontal pockets, effectively responding to periodontitis microenvironment. Meanwhile, this hydrogel effectively alleviated alveolar bone loss in vivo. Overall, the developed MH@ZIF-8/CS/β-GP hydrogel presents a novel strategy for chronic periodontitis treatment and demonstrates promising clinical application potential.

10.1111/eje.12828	Concept map-based learning in an oral radiographic interpretation course: Dental	Gil YM, Lee BD	OBJECTIVES: Concept mapping is used to promote critical thinking and meaningful learning in health professions education. This study aimed to evaluate dental undergraduates' perceptions of concept mapping as a learning tool for oral radiographic interpretation competency. METHODS: A total of 39 third-year undergraduates at a dental college participated in the oral radiological interpretation session. The students received 1 hour of instruction before creating their concept map (CM). Participants were provided an assignment of four relevant clinical cases to draw an individualised CM. The students' draft and final CM were submitted. The instructor evaluated the CMs to identify whether students could analyse, connect and organise the information in a meaningful way. Among them, 37 completed the questionnaire about their experiences and responses to concept mapping. RESULTS: Students perceived concept mapping positively. The instructor's feedback helped them recognise their misconceptions and fostered greater motivation to learn. Students attempted to integrate basic biomedical knowledge and clinical features through cross-linking. However, they also expressed negative attitudes toward concept mapping regarding time consumption and heavy burden. CONCLUSIONS: Concept mapping motivated students' directed learning and gave them the opportunity to recognise their misconceptions. This study suggests the potential use of CMs as an adjunctive learning strategy in the oral radiographic interpretation class.

10.1016/j.phymed.2025.157043	Jinkui Shenqi pills improve pancreatic islet function in diabetes by modulating	Zhang S, Song C, Zhang W, Wen Z, Zhang Y, Chen Y, Zhuang Z, Liu X, Chen C, Ni Q	BACKGROUND: Macrophage infiltration is a key contributor to pancreatic β-cell dysfunction, though the mechanisms of inflammatory activation are unclear. In China, Jinkui Shenqi pills (JSP) are known for its hypoglycemic effects and pancreatic protective properties, but its role in macrophage-mediated inflammation is unstudied. PURPOSE: This study investigated the effects of JSP on macrophage polarization and its underlying molecular mechanisms. METHODS: Type 2 diabetes mouse model was induced by high-fat diet combined with streptozotocin. Fasting glucose, insulin, lipid profiles, HOMA-IR, and HOMA-β were measured. Islet structure was evaluated by HE staining and electron microscopy, and qRT-PCR detected dedifferentiation markers. Flow cytometry assessed pancreatic M1 and M2 macrophage percentages. Targeted glucose metabolomics analyzed JSP's effect on succinate levels. In vitro, JSP-containing serum effects on macrophage polarization were analyzed by fluorescence and morphological observations. Succinate was employed to reverse-validate the effects of JSP on the succinate/HIF1α axis. Macrophage-conditioned medium was co-cultured with islet cells to clarify JSP's role in regulating β-cell function. PX478 inhibited HIF1α activity in vivo and in vitro to observe its hypoglycemic, macrophage polarization, and islet-protective effects. RESULTS: JSP reduced blood glucose and lipid levels, enhanced insulin secretion, and improved insulin resistance. JSP inhibited macrophage infiltration, reduced the M1 macrophages (CD45(+)CD11b(+)F4/80(+)CD86(+)) percentage (p < 0.05), and increased M2 macrophages (CD45(+)CD11b(+)F4/80(+)CD206(+)) percentage (p < 0.01). It improved glycolysis, TCA cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation pathways, inhibited succinate accumulation, and was associated with HIF1α signaling. In vitro, JSP inhibited HIF1α nuclear accumulation, reduced pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1,	Phytomedicine : international journal of phytotherapy and phytopharmacology	5/07/2025

While some studies suggest that neuroinflammation potentiates neurodegeneration, others indicate a protective effect. METHODS: We evaluated 145 individuals with positron emission tomography (PET) for amyloid beta (Aβ), tau, and translocator protein (TSPO), a proxy of neuroinflammation, to test the hypothesis that Aβ and tau are associated with the dual effect of neuroinflammation on neurodegeneration across the AD continuum. RESULTS: The detrimental effects of neuroinflammation on gray matter density occurred in two waves. The first neuroinflammation-related detrimental wave was associated with brain Aβ deposition, while the second was with widespread tau tangle pathology. Furthermore, the concomitant presence of neuroinflammation, Aβ, and tau was associated with faster cognitive decline over 2 years. CONCLUSIONS: Our results support a model in which Aβ- and tau-associated neuroinflammation are related to two waves of deleterious effects on AD-related neurodegeneration. HIGHLIGHTS: Two waves of detrimental neuroinflammation effects on brain density associated with Aβ or tau. Aβ associated with deleterious effect of neuroinflammation on brain density in early AD. Tau associated with deleterious effect of neuroinflammation on brain density in late AD. Interactions of Aβ, tau, and neuroinflammation are associated with cognitive decline.

10.3310/DWKT1327	Effectiveness of surgical interventions in patients with severe pressure ulcers:	Reeves B, Pufulete M, Harris J, Dumville J, Adderley U, Burton A, Burton M, Atkinson R, Clout M, Cullum N, O'Connell A, O'Connor L, Palmer S, Ridd M, Rodrigues J, Wong J	BACKGROUND: Surgical reconstruction to close a severe pressure ulcer has not been evaluated. AIM AND OBJECTIVES: We aimed to investigate the feasibility of research to evaluate surgical reconstruction for severe pressure ulcers by: systematically reviewing evidence about: the effectiveness of surgical reconstruction for severe pressure ulcers; the impact of pressure ulceration on health-related quality-of-life (review 2) surveying primary and secondary care healthcare professionals about surgical referrals of patients with severe pressure ulcers and severe pressure ulcer management, including surgical reconstruction describing patients with incident pressure ulcers and with severe pressure ulcers having surgical reconstruction comparing outcomes in patients with severe pressure ulcers having/not having surgical reconstruction seeking consensus about treatments and management strategies for severe pressure ulcers. DESIGN: Systematic reviews; surveys; binary choice experiment; retrospective cohort studies using routine data; consensus meeting. PARTICIPANTS: General practitioners; nurses; and surgeons managing pressure ulcers; people with incident pressure ulcers and hospitalised with severe pressure ulcers. INTERVENTION: Surgical reconstruction. COMPARATOR: No surgical reconstruction. OUTCOMES: Surgical reconstruction, time to next admission with a severe pressure ulcer time to next admission, hospital stay, all-cause mortality, surgical reconstruction after discharge. RESULTS: Review 1 included three studies comparing different surgical reconstruction techniques. None reported wound-free time. Recurrence occurred in ≈ 20%. Review 2 included three randomised controlled trials measuring health-related quality of life, but none observed benefits of interventions evaluated. Among primary care survey respondents, 54% did not know surgical reconstruction can treat severe pressure ulcers; > 50% had never referred a patient to a surgeon. Among nurses, 72% had considered surgical reconstruction for a severe pressure ulcer; 54% believed surgical reconstruction should be more available. Among surgeons, 39% had never offered surgical reconstruction and 52% offered surgical reconstruction to < 50%; 68% believed surgical reconstruction should be more available. Routine data recorded 367,884 admissions with severe pressure ulcer diagnoses in England over 7.5 years; surgical reconstructions were performed in at least 404 and at most 1018 admissions. Twenty English hospitals performed > 70% of the surgical reconstructions. Comparing surgical reconstruction (n = 325) versus no surgical reconstruction (n = 1474) patients, time to next admission with a severe pressure ulcer was longer in patients having surgical reconstruction (hazard ratio = 0.79, 95% confidence interval 0.61 to 1.03; p = 0.07). Estimated pressure ulcer incidence in primary care was ≈ 5/10,000, but the true incidence was believed to be ≈ 7 times higher. Episodes of pressure ulcer care could not be identified. There was consensus about a referral pathway for severe pressure ulcer patients wanting surgical reconstruction, including both community-led and surgically led multidisciplinary team meetings, and about the influence of several patient and severe pressure ulcer characteristics on suitability for surgical reconstruction. LIMITATIONS: Surveys only considered factors one by one. Analyses of the Hospital Episode Statistics cohort depended on coding accuracy. For the comparison of surgical reconstruction and no surgical reconstruction, the no surgical reconstruction group had to be admitted. Routine data do not record wound healing outcomes. Primary care data underestimated pressure ulcer incidence; pressure ulcer care episodes could not be identified. The consensus meeting did not include surgeons. The COVID-19 pandemic caused delays, made team members unavailable and restricted face-to-face meetings. CONCLUSIONS: There is insufficient evidence to determine the effectiveness of surgical reconstruction on health-related quality of life or wound healing for severe pressure ulcers. Too few procedures are carried out to enable a randomised controlled trial to be feasible. FUTURE WORK: We identified three areas: qualitative research on the acceptability of surgical reconstruction and the impact of a SPU on a patient's quality-of-life; a core outcome set for interventions to treat pressure ulcers; and economic modelling of surgical reconstruction cost-effectiveness.

10.1016/j.ejphar.2025.178187	Mapping the Evolving Landscape of Lecanemab Research in Alzheimer's Disease: A	Zhao X, Ma R, Shen J, Xu D, Yang Z	"BACKGROUND: Lecanemab, a monoclonal antibody that targets amyloid-beta aggregates, has emerged as a promising therapeutic for Alzheimer's disease (AD). AD is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by cognitive decline and amyloid pathology. Research on the use of lecanemab in treating AD has increased; however, no relevant bibliometric analyses have been conducted. To address this gap, this study employed bibliometric methods to search for the relevant literature and analyze research trends investigating AD and lecanemab. METHODS: We performed a literature search of the Web of Science core database for studies investigating AD and lecanemab, published from database inception up to April 3rd, 2025. After rigorous screening, Excel, VOSviewer, and CiteSpace were used to perform a bibliometric analysis of publications, citations, and collaboration networks among countries, institutions, and authors, along with cluster and burst analyses of keywords. Coremine was used for text mining entries significantly related to AD and lecanemab. RESULTS: The number of studies published on AD and lecanemab has increased annually. The countries with the highest publication output were the United States, the United Kingdom, and China. The leading institutions that produced the most articles were Eisai Inc. (Bunkyo City, Tokyo, Japan), Uppsala University (Uppsala, Sweden), and Harvard Medical School (Boston, MA, USA). The top three authors were Lars Lannfelt, Shobha Dhadda, and Michio Kanekiyo. The most prolific journals included The Journal of Alzheimer's Disease, Alzheimer's and Dementia, and Ageing Research Reviews. The most cited article was ""Lecanemab in Early Alzheimer's Disease,"" by Van Dyck et al., published in The New England Journal of Medicine in 2023, which has accrued 172 citations. The 10 most frequently occurring keywords were Alzheimer's disease, lecanemab, dementia, aducanumab, amyloid-beta, immunotherapy, tau, a-beta, mouse model, and donanemab. Text mining revealed that drugs, anatomical structures, chemical molecules, genes, diseases, and procedures were significantly associated with both AD and lecanemab. CONCLUSION: The bibliometric and text mining analysis revealed trends in research investigating the correlation between lecanemab and AD. It analyzed the cooperation among countries, regions, and authors, highlighting recent research hotspots. These data offer objective insights for scientific research and clinical practice on lecanemab and AD. These findings provide a roadmap for prioritizing clinical trials, optimizing drug development strategies, and addressing knowledge gaps in amyloid-targeted therapies."

10.12688/f1000research.163923.3	​​Dapagliflozin vs. Empagliflozin for cardiorenal risk reduction: Real-world	Cokro F, Sauriasari R, Tahapary DL, Setiawan H, Tricaesario C, Hidayati N, Soegondo S	BACKGROUND: Previous studies compared the cardiorenal efficacy of these two types of SGLT2 inhibitors; however, the findings are inconsistent and do not reflect the population of Type 2 diabetic Mellitus (T2DM) patients in Indonesia, which ranks fifth globally in diabetes prevalence. This study aims to evaluate the effects and safety of dapagliflozin and empagliflozin on cardiorenal risk factors in T2DM Indonesian patients over a 12-month. METHODS: This study utilized a multicenter retrospective cohort to evaluate diverse cardiorenal risk factors, encompassing glycemic control, blood pressure, lipid profile, body weight, Body Mass Index (BMI), calculated 10-year Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease (ASCVD) risk, and estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR), alongside the safety profile of SGLT2is. Paired data analysis, comparative analysis between groups, and linear regression were conducted to adjust the confounding. RESULTS: Both groups exhibited enhancements in HbA1c, Fasting Plasma Glucose (FPG), Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP), and Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (LDL-C). Improvements in BMI, Diastolic Blood Pressure (DBP), triglycerides, ASCVD risk, and High-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (HDL-C) were only seen in the dapagliflozin group. Although dapagliflozin was associated with greater reductions in body weight and BMI, these differences were not statistically significant after adjustment for confounding factors. No significant differences were observed in the average alteration of HbA1c, FPG, SBP, DBP, LDL-C, HDL-C, triglycerides, total cholesterol, eGFR, and ASCVD risk values. A comparable safety profile was found between groups. CONCLUSION: Dapagliflozin and Empagliflozin provide similar advantages in reducing cardiorenal risk and safety after 12 months of treatment in Indonesian patients with T2DM.	F1000Research	01/01/2025
10.1007/s00535-025-02304-1	Long-term risk of inflammatory bowel disease in patients with irritable bowel	Song H, Zhou Y, Liu S, Zhang Q, Zhang S, Zhu S, Wu S	BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are distinct gastrointestinal disorders with overlapping symptoms and pathophysiological background. The long-term risk of IBD is unclear in IBS patients. METHODS: Overall, 447,631 participants free of IBD at baseline (2006-2010) and 76,992 individuals who completed Digestive Health Questionnaire (2017-2018) from UK Biobank were enrolled in longitudinal cohort and cross-sectional analysis, respectively. The primary outcome was incident IBD in the cohort design, and Cox proportional hazards model was conducted to estimate the associated hazard ratio (HR). Prevalent IBD was defined as primary outcome in the cross-sectional design, and logistic regression was performed to estimate the associated odds ratio (OR). RESULTS: In the cohort design, 2,916 incident IBD cases were identified during a median 14.2 years' follow-up, with 2,097 ulcerative colitis (UC) and 1,015 Crohn's disease (CD), respectively. IBS patients had a 68%, 60%, and 104% increased risk of IBD (HR = 1.68, 95% CI:1.47-1.92), UC (HR = 1.60, 1.36-1.89), and CD (HR = 2.04, 1.66-2.51) versus non-IBS participants. Moreover, a greater risk of incident IBD persisted in IBS patients even after 10 years' duration (HR = 1.55, 1.27-1.89). In cross-sectional analysis, IBS patients exhibited significantly elevated odds of IBD (OR = 2.40, 2.14-2.70), UC (OR = 2.18, 1.92-2.48), and CD (OR = 3.15, 2.68-3.70). A greater odds of IBD was observed among all IBS subtypes, with IBS-D showing the highest odds (OR = 3.72, 3.24-4.28). CONCLUSIONS: The risk of incident IBD, either UC or CD, is significantly higher in IBS patients compared with the general population, especially in IBS-D patients.

Targeted therapies have improved treatment outcomes as driver mutations have been identified, especially in adenocarcinomas. Comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) provides insights into the genetic mutation profile of cancer and helps identify actionable mutations. The mutational landscape of cancer varies based on the patient's ethnic background, and there is limited information on the genetic profile of NSCLC within the Finnish population. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We analysed the genetic mutational profile of 96 advanced NSCLCs that underwent CGP between November 2021 and March 2023 at Tampere University Hospital. Additionally, we compared the genomic alterations in our cohort with those in the international datasets. RESULTS: Clinically actionable alterations associated with a targeted therapy were identified in 45% of patients, including 63% of never-smokers and 41% of ever-smokers. The most common actionable alteration was KRAS G12C (18%), followed by EGFR alterations (14%). However, only 33% of the patients with an actionable alteration received targeted therapy. The median tumour mutational burden (TMB) was 5, with 31% of patients exhibiting a TMB greater than 10. CONCLUSIONS: CGP affects the treatment strategies for NSCLC. Nearly half of our entire cohort had a genetic alteration eligible for approved targeted therapies. Besides these findings, CGP provides additional data to assess treatment decisions and outcomes, including co-occurring genetic alterations and TMB. In real-world clinical practice, the practical application of this information can be restricted by the varying unavailability of optimal treatments.	Cancer medicine	01/10/2025
10.1002/ejhf.70033	Blood pressure, safety and clinical efficacy of vericiguat in chronic heart	Mentz RJ, Butler J, McMullan CJ, Wojdyla DM, Anstrom KJ, Barash I, Bonaca MP, Borentain M, Corda S, Ezekowitz JA, Gates D, Lam CSP, Lewis EF, Lindenfeld J, O'Connor CM, Ponikowski P, Reddy YNV, Rosano GMC, Saldarriaga C, Senni M, Teixeira PP, Udelson J, Urbinati A, Vlajnic V, Voors AA, Xing A, Zannad F	AIMS: The efficacy and safety of vericiguat in patients with chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) on contemporary heart failure (HF) therapies and without recent worsening was investigated in the VICTOR trial, yet some subgroups may be more susceptible to symptomatic hypotension. METHODS AND RESULTS: Among VICTOR trial participants that received at least one dose of study drug or placebo, we describe the systolic blood pressure (SBP) trajectories over time (mean change from baseline), symptomatic hypotension events and efficacy of vericiguat in potentially vulnerable patient subgroups: lower baseline blood pressure (SBP ≤110 mmHg), older patients (>75 years) and those taking angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitors (ARNI) or sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) at baseline. The efficacy outcomes of cardiovascular death and HF hospitalization and cardiovascular death alone across baseline SBP were examined using Cox proportional hazards models. Overall SBP trajectories showed a small initial decline from baseline in vericiguat-treated patients compared with placebo (placebo-corrected differences of -1.17 [-1.84, -0.50], p = 0.0007) that was relatively stable throughout follow-up. This trajectory was similar in those >75 years (vs. younger) as well as those receiving ARNI or SGLT2i (as compared with those not receiving these) or those with SBP ≤110 mmHg at baseline (compared with >110 mmHg). Symptomatic hypotension occurred in 11.3% of vericiguat-treated patients compared with 9.2% of placebo-treated patients with an adjusted hazard ratio of 1.24 (95% confidence interval 1.06-1.46), which was similar across age, SBP, SGLT2i and ARNI groups (all interaction p >0.05). The treatment effect of vericiguat compared with placebo on the efficacy outcomes was similar across the spectrum of baseline SBP (both interaction p >0.15). CONCLUSIONS: Vericiguat showed a slight adjusted decrease in SBP and resulted in more symptomatic hypotension compared with placebo but was overall well-tolerated in a broad population with HFrEF on contemporary therapy even among those predisposed to hypotension. Treatment effects on efficacy outcomes were consistent regardless of baseline SBP.	European journal of heart failure	29/09/2025
10.1007/s00432-025-06336-1	Management of hepatotoxicity associated with CDK4/6 inhibitors and rechallenge	İlhan N, Baş S, Alkan O, Doğan A, Majidova N, Tunç MA, Erdemoğlu E, Öztosun B, Ökten İN, Gümüş M	BACKGROUND: Cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 (CDK4/6) inhibitors combined with endocrine therapy have significantly improved clinical outcomes in patients with hormone receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HR + /HER2-) metastatic breast cancer. Hepatotoxicity is a known class-related adverse event that may interrupt or modify treatment. However, real-world evidence on its incidence, risk factors, and management strategies-particularly rechallenge approaches-remains limited. This study aimed to evaluate the frequency and clinical characteristics of CDK4/6 inhibitor-associated hepatotoxicity, to identify risk factors, and to assess the outcomes and safety of rechallenge following liver injury. METHODS: This retrospective multicenter study included 544 patients with HR+ /HER2- metastatic breast cancer who were treated with ribociclib or palbociclib between January 2017 and July 2024 in oncology centers across Turkey. Abemaciclib was not included due to reimbursement limitations during the study period. Patient characteristics, comorbidities, concomitant medications, and herbal or dietary supplement use were recorded. Liver function tests and viral hepatitis serologies were analyzed. Hepatotoxicity was graded using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v5.0), and causality was assessed with the Roussel Uclaf Causality Assessment Method (RUCAM). Management strategies-including dose interruption, dose reduction, switching to another CDK4/6 inhibitor, and outcomes of rechallenge were evaluated. RESULTS: Hepatotoxicity occurred in 10.5% of patients, most commonly in a hepatocellular pattern. Ribociclib was the most frequently used agent. Younger age, herbal supplement use, and hepatitis B carrier status were significantly associated with increased risk of hepatotoxicity. All hepatotoxic events were managed conservatively. None of the patients developed acute liver failure or required invasive evaluation. Dose reduction or switching to the alternate agent was attempted in most patients after enzyme normalization and was successful in the majority, with no recurrence of severe hepatotoxicity. CONCLUSION: CDK4/6 inhibitor-related hepatotoxicity is manageable with careful monitoring and individualized strategies. Timely dose interruption, switching agents, or cautious rechallenge allowed most patients to resume therapy safely. These findings support the continued use of CDK4/6 inhibitors in eligible patients, even after hepatotoxicity events.	Journal of cancer research and clinical oncology	27/09/2025
10.1038/s41467-025-63864-7	An injury-associated lobular microniche is associated with the classical tumor	Söderqvist S, Viljamaa A, Geyer N, Keller AL, Ruksha K, Strell C, Hekmati N, Niculae A, Engstrand J, Sparrelid E, Salmén C, Costa TDF, Zhao M, Strömblad S, Zacharouli A, Ghorbani P, Harrizi S, Hamidi Y, Khorosjutina O, Milanova S, Schmierer B, Bozóky B, Fernández Moro C, Gerling M	Pancreatic cancer is an aggressive disease with a dense fibrotic stroma and is often accompanied by chronic inflammation. Peritumoral inflammation is typically viewed as a reaction to nearby tumor growth. Here, we report that the inflamed pancreatic lobules are frequently invaded by tumor cells, forming a distinct, non-fibrotic tumor niche. Using a semi-supervised machine learning approach for annotations of clinical samples and multiplex protein profiling, we show that tumor cells at the invasion front are closely associated with acinar cells undergoing damage-induced changes, and with activated fibroblasts expressing markers of injury. The invaded lobules are linked to classical tumor phenotypes, in contrast to fibrotic areas where tumor cells display a more basal profile, highlighting microenvironment-dependent tumor subtype differences. In female mice, lobular invasion similarly aligns with the classical tumor phenotype. Together, our data reveal that pancreatic tumors colonize injured lobules, creating a unique niche that shapes tumor characteristics and contributes to disease biology.

10.1038/s41467-025-63429-8	Aging in mice alters regionally enriched striatal astrocytes.	Linker KE, Duran-Laforet V, Ollivier M, Yu X, Schafer DP, Khakh BS	Aging affects multiple organs and within the brain drives distinct molecular changes across different cell types. The striatum encodes motor behaviors that decline with age, but our understanding of how cells within the striatum change remains incomplete. Using single-cell RNA sequencing from young and aged mice we identify molecularly distinct astrocyte subtypes. We show that astrocytes change significantly with age, exhibiting downregulation of genes, reduced diversity, and a shift to more homogenous inflammatory transcriptomic profiles. By exploring where striatal astrocyte subtypes are located with single-cell resolution, we map astrocytes enriched in dorsal, medial, and ventral striatum. Age increases inflammatory marker transcripts in dorsal striatal astrocytes, which display greater age-related changes than ventral striatal astrocytes. We impute molecular interactions between astrocytes and neurons and find that age particularly reduced interactions related to Nrxn2. Our data show that aging alters regionally enriched striatal astrocytes asymmetrically, with dorsal striatal astrocytes exhibiting greater age-related molecular changes.

10.1002/bcp.70296	Prescription use of acetaminophen among pregnant women in Denmark from 2000 to	Gram EB, Bliddal M, Pflugfelder S, Jensen PB, Damkier P	AIMS: The aim of this study was to describe prescription use of acetaminophen, a widely used analgesic and antipyretic generally considered safe during pregnancy, among pregnant women from 2000 to 2023 in Denmark with special attention towards variations following the change in over-the-counter (OTC) availability in 2013. METHODS: In this population-based drug utilization study, individually linked data from nationwide health registries on pregnant women in Denmark between 2000 and 2023 were used to evaluate time trends on prescription use of acetaminophen and describe distributions of maternal characteristics among prescription-based drug users and non-users. RESULTS: Among 1 446 841 eligible pregnancies included, 27 per 1000 pregnant women redeemed at least one prescription for acetaminophen during pregnancy, and among these, 18% redeemed more than one. In 2023, 74 per 1000 pregnancies were exposed to prescription use of acetaminophen. Relative to non-users, prescription-based drug users were generally older and had a higher body mass index. They more frequently presented with pain-related, chronic or psychiatric conditions and used other prescription medications throughout the study period. However, these differences were less pronounced in the cohort restricted to pregnancies ending in 2015-2023 compared to 2000-2012. CONCLUSIONS: Prescription use of acetaminophen in the pregnant population in Denmark has increased since 2000, with a notable sharp increase from 2013 onwards, coinciding with the regulatory restriction that reduced over-the-counter pack sizes, alongside a concurrent rise in general-population prescription use. Prescription-based drug users were more likely to have comorbidities and multiple medication use than non-users, although these differences have become less pronounced in recent years.

10.1038/s41598-021-82296-z	Predicting the probability of Gaucher disease in subjects with splenomegaly and	Motta I, Consonni D, Stroppiano M, Benedetto C, Cassinerio E, Tappino B, Ranalli P, Borin L, Facchini L, Patriarca A, Barcellini W, Lanza F, Filocamo M, Cappellini MD	Hematologists are frequently involved in the diagnostic pathway of Gaucher disease type 1 (GD1) patients since they present several hematological signs. However, GD1 is mainly underdiagnosed because of a lack of awareness. In this multicenter study, we combine the use of a diagnostic algorithm with a simple test (β-glucosidase activity on Dried Blood Spot) in order to facilitate the diagnosis in a population presenting to the hematologist with splenomegaly and/or thrombocytopenia associated with other hematological signs. In this high-risk population, the prevalence of GD1 is 3.3%. We propose an equation that predicts the probability of having GD1 according to three parameters that are routinely evaluated: platelet count, ferritin, and transferrin saturation.

10.1002/ptr.70100	Hesperidin Inhibits Oxidative Stress and Apoptosis of Granulosa Cells in	Zhang Q, Yang Z, Ou X, Zhang M, Ji R, Wu G	Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrine-metabolic disorder syndrome in women of childbearing age. Hesperidin (HES), a phytoflavonoid glycoside found in citrus fruits such as oranges and lemons, has a variety of pharmacological effects. HES has been extensively studied to protect a variety of tissues from oxidative damage. However, it is not known whether HES may have a therapeutic effect on PCOS. In this study, potential therapeutic targets for HES treatment of PCOS were identified through network pharmacology, altered phosphorylation modification of JAK2 and PI3K was verified in granular cells of PCOS patients, and the mechanism of HES treatment of PCOS was revealed through in vivo and in vitro experiments. Based on network-based pharmacological studies, PI3K/Akt and JAK2/STAT3 pathways are potential pathways for HES treatment of PCOS, and molecular docking results show that JAK2 has the best binding activity with HES. Western blotting results showed that the phosphorylation modification of JAK2 and PI3K in granular cells of PCOS patients was changed. Experiments in KGN cell lines have shown that HES can reduce DHT-induced oxidative stress and apoptotic damage. Activating JAK2 or inhibiting PI3K can both reverse this therapeutic effect. In vivo experiments have shown similar results. HES affects oxidative stress and apoptosis in PCOS through signaling crosstalk between JAK2/STAT3 and PI3K/AKT pathways.

10.1186/s13287-025-04638-2	Efficacy and safety of single versus repeated injections of mesenchymal stem	Deng L, Zhao C, Zhou L, Mu X, Sun H, Li L, Zhang Y	BACKGROUND: In recent years, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been widely applied in the clinical treatment of knee osteoarthritis (KOA), demonstrating promising therapeutic efficacy. However, intervention protocols for MSCs have not yet been standardized, and evidence regarding the impact of different injection frequencies on the efficacy and safety of MSC treatment in KOA remains limited. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to integrate evidence from conventional and network meta-analyses to evaluate the efficacy and safety of different intervention frequencies (single vs. repeated MSC injections) in the treatment of knee osteoarthritis (KOA). METHODS: A systematic search was conducted in PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and Web of Science databases up to March 1, 2025. Traditional meta-analysis was performed to assess the efficacy and safety of MSC therapy for KOA, followed by a network meta-analysis (NMA) to evaluate the effectiveness of single versus repeated MSC injections. Outcome measures included WOMAC and VAS scores at 3, 6, and 12 months, as well as the incidence of adverse events (AEs). Traditional meta-analysis and NMA were conducted using Review Manager 5.3 and Stata SE16.0, respectively. RESULTS: A total of 16 RCTs involving 622 patients were included. Traditional meta-analysis showed that MSC therapy significantly improved pain and knee joint function in KOA patients at different time points (3, 6, and 12 months). The results of the network meta-analysis (NMA) indicated that, compared to single MSC injections, repeated MSC injections provided greater improvements in pain and functional scores at 6 and 12 months, demonstrating superior efficacy. However, repeated MSC injections were also associated with a higher incidence of adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: Both single and repeated MSC injections could improve pain and knee joint function in patients with KOA. Compared to single injections, repeated MSC injections may offer superior therapeutic benefits; however, they are associated with a higher incidence of adverse events. In clinical practice, potential side effects of repeated MSC administration must be carefully considered. Future research should focus on large-scale, multicenter, and long-term randomized controlled trials to further validate the efficacy and safety of MSC therapy for KOA.

10.1016/j.tplants.2025.08.020	Phytohormones revisited: what makes a compound a hormone in plants.	Munné-Bosch S	Since the discovery of auxins as cell division factors a century ago, impressive scientific advances related to phytohormones have revolutionized plant sciences and human progress. This review examines the key features of the ten hormonal groups that operate in plants, here referred to as the 'classical ten': auxins, gibberellins (GAs), cytokinins (CKs), abscisic acid (ABA), ethylene (ETH), salicylates (SAs), jasmonates (JAs), brassinosteroids (BRs), peptide hormones (PEPs), and strigolactones (SLs). By leveraging historical data and sharpening the essentials of each hormonal group, their major functions are presented, with a discussion on what makes a compound a phytohormone and how it can be differentiated from hormone-like compounds and other signaling molecules. Hormonal receptors, long-distance transport, and differences between hormonal crosstalk, interactions, and complementation are discussed to illustrate the basics of hormonal action in plants.

10.1016/j.ejim.2025.106528	Effectiveness of tezepelumab in severe asthma: A multicenter real-world study.	Poto R, Manganello G, di Salvatore A, Capitelli L, Lagnese G, Messuri C, Muto T, De Michele F, Varricchi G	Severe asthma is a complex, heterogeneous disease that remains a major therapeutic challenge. Despite several biologics targeting type 2 (T2) inflammation, some patients remain uncontrolled, highlighting the need for upstream interventions. Tezepelumab, a monoclonal antibody against thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), has shown broad efficacy in randomized trials regardless of eosinophilic status or biomarker levels. We conducted a prospective, multicenter, observational study to assess real-world effectiveness and safety of tezepelumab in severe asthma. Thirty patients were enrolled at two tertiary centers in Italy between September 2023 and December 2024. Inclusion criteria were a severe asthma diagnosis per ERS and GINA 2024 guidelines and inadequate control despite maximal inhaled therapy. Tezepelumab was given at 210 mg every 4 weeks. Clinical, functional, and biomarker data were collected at baseline, 1 month, and 6 months. After six months, patients showed significant improvement in Asthma Control Test (ACT) score, with marked reductions in oral glucocorticoid use and exacerbation rate. Sinonasal symptoms improved over time. Blood eosinophils and FeNO decreased significantly, while total IgE remained unchanged. Lung function improved in both FEV(1)/FVC ratio and FEF(25-75), suggesting benefit on airflow limitation and small airway function. No serious adverse events occurred. Improvements were consistent in both T2-high and T2-low subgroups. This real-world study confirms tezepelumab's clinical effectiveness and safety in severe asthma. Benefits across inflammatory phenotypes support TSLP blockade as a broad-spectrum therapeutic approach. Larger, longer-term studies are warranted to confirm results and identify response predictors.

10.1016/j.ctrv.2025.103024	Impact of brain metastases on systemic renal cell carcinoma treatment outcomes: A	Charnley N, Fife K, Heng DYC, Larkin J, McGrane J, Négrier S, Vasudev N, Venugopal B, Chisholm A, Ogareva A, Prendergast Á, Albiges L	INTRODUCTION: Brain metastases (BrM) are a negative prognostic factor in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) populations. Patients with RCC and BrM (RCC BrM + ) may receive systemic therapy and/or brain-targeted (local) treatment. We performed a systematic literature review to identify clinical trials and non-interventional studies reporting data on BrM impact on systemic treatment outcomes in patients with RCC. METHODS: We systematically searched the MEDLINE and Embase databases in January 2024 for publications reporting efficacy/effectiveness and/or safety/tolerability outcomes by BrM status from phase 2 and phase 3 clinical trials and non-interventional studies of systemic RCC therapies. Data were extracted from publications meeting predefined criteria (PROSPERO registration, CRD42023494896) and reported in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. RESULTS: Sixty-two publications (of 651 screened) were eligible (4 from prospective trials) and included 4,637 patients with RCC BrM + treated with systemic therapy. The most evaluated systemic therapies were sunitinib, nivolumab, ipilimumab + nivolumab, cabozantinib and sorafenib. Tolerability was generally consistent with known safety profiles in RCC trial populations. In the clinical trials, systemic treatment benefits for patients with RCC BrM + were equivocal. In non-interventional studies, survival was generally poorer in patients with RCC BrM + than reference groups (overall/BrM-). Survival and intracranial control benefits in patients with RCC BrM + were reported for some multimodal (systemic plus local) treatment strategies. There were no robust comparative data to guide systemic treatment selection. CONCLUSION: We identified a need for robust data on intracranial and extracranial responses to systemic therapy in patients with RCC BrM+, taking into account prior local therapy exposure.

10.1007/s10528-025-11222-z	Detection of Vancomycin Resistance Enterococcus Species Holding Genes vanA, vanB,	Abbas KF, Motaweq ZY	Enterococci were hospitalized and resistant to numerous antibiotics. The present research aimed to determine the Vancomycin sensitivity by disc and Minimum Inhibitory Concentrations (MICs), also detecting the relationship between Vancomycin resistance genes and the Vancomycin resistance in uropathogenic Enterococcus species. Totally, 150 urine specimens were obtained from patients who attended or admitted to Iraq hospitals. The bacteriological tests besides Vietic and (ddl of E. faecalis, ddl of E. faecium) genes were implemented for the identification of Enterococcus isolates. We indicate 27 Enterococcus isolates, among which 18 (66.7%) were E. faecalis, 4 (14.8%) were E. faecium, while 5 (18.5%) were other isolates belonging to the rest of Enterococcus species. The antibiotic resistance by disk-diffusion technique for Penicillin, Ampicillin, Vancomycin, Norfloxacin, Erythromycin, Ciprofloxacin, Rifampin, Levofloxacin, Chloramphenicol, Fosfomycin, Doxycycline, Minocycline, and Nitrofurantoin was 7 (25,92%), 7 (25,92%), 6 (22.22%), 5 (18.51%), 24 (88.89%), 5 (18.51%), 23 (85.18%), 5 (18.51%), 4 (14.81%), 14 (51.85%), 0 (0%), 3 (11.11%), and 1 (3.70%), respectively. The total isolates were Vancomycin Resistance Enterococci VRE using the MIC technique. Positive results for vanA 23 (85.18%), vanB 11 (40.74%), vanC1 3 (11.11%), vanC2, and vanC3 3 (11.11%). The results revealed that 23 (85.18%) out of VRE isolates possessed the Vancomycin-resistance genes. Although four isolates did not hold van genes, the resistance may be attributed to the occurrence of uncommon genes which not identified by this study; also the efflux pump has a role in resistance. The van genes might be transmitted, so important to monitor antibiotic resistance.	Biochemical genetics	27/09/2025

However, little is known about coronaviruses as vectors for delivering vaccines. Here, we have developed safe SARS-CoV-2 Omicron JN.1-based live attenuated vaccine candidates by combining a mutation (D130A) in the viral nsp16 protein, deletion of the furin cleavage site (dFCS) in the spike protein, deletion of accessory proteins, and/or modification of the transcription regulatory sequences (mTRS). Subsequently, using rJN.1, rJN.1-D130A-dFCS, and rJN.1-mTRS-D130A-dFCS as the backbones, we generated three recombinant viruses expressing a nonfunctional, soluble, and stabilized prefusion F protein of human respiratory syncytial virus (RSVF). Among them, rJN.1-D130A-dFCS-RSVF virus was sufficiently attenuated and highly immunogenic, providing complete protection against challenge with both JN.1 and RSV in hamsters. However, rJN.1-mTRS-D130A-dFCS-RSVF was poorly immunogenic. Collectively, we demonstrate that attenuated SARS-CoV-2 is an effective viral vector for delivering RSV vaccine, warranting further development as a novel intranasal bivalent vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 and RSV.

Moreover, 30-50% of patients still derive no therapeutic benefit from the combination strategy, highlighting the need to decipher and overcome resistance. OBJECTIVE: We sought to investigate the mechanisms by which chemotherapy augments the responses to immune checkpoint blockade and elucidate the factors contributing to persistent resistance in non-responding patients. DESIGN: We designed a systematic investigation involving longitudinal sampling of ESCC tissues both from patients treated with chemotherapy plus anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-1 monotherapy. The tumour microenvironment (TME) was then comprehensively characterised using single-cell transcriptomics, T cell receptor repertoire analysis, multiplex immunohistochemistry and murine models. RESULTS: We demonstrated that combination therapy exerted superior antitumour efficacy by mitigating immune checkpoint engagements (TIGIT-NECTIN2 and NECTIN1-CD96) between epithelial-stress tumour cells and CD8(+) T cells, thereby preventing T cells from exhaustion and boosting vitality. In non-responders, we identified a subset of tumour cells with high SLC1A3 expression, which localised at the tumour boundary and interacted with COL1A1(+) myofibroblastic cancer-associated fibroblasts, inducing an extracellular matrix-enriched TME that hindered the infiltration of CD8(+) T cells. Inhibiting SLC1A3 significantly enhanced the efficacy of chemotherapy plus anti-PD-1, underscoring its potential as a therapeutic target. CONCLUSION: This study elucidates the synergistic mechanisms and identifies key resistance pathways underlying chemo-immunotherapy combinations in patients with ESCC, providing a scientific basis for refining future combination therapeutic regimens.

10.3390/nu17183002	Omega-3 Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids and Cognitive Decline in Adults with	Barros MI, Brandão T, Irving SC, Alves P, Gomes F, Correia M	BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: As global aging accelerates, prevalence of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) continues to rise, challenging healthcare systems and diminishing older adults' quality of life. There is great interest in better understanding the neuroprotective/anti-inflammatory properties of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids but the results from many published studies in humans come to different conclusions. This review aims to clarify the efficacy of n-3 fatty acids as a preventive or therapeutic strategy for cognitive health and to inform future clinical recommendations within aging populations. METHODS: Following PRISMA guidelines and a registered PROSPERO protocol, we reviewed systematic reviews (SRs) from 2014 to 2024 assessing exclusive n-3 fatty acid supplementation and cognitive outcomes via MMSE. Data were extracted on intervention details and cognitive scores. Meta-analyses used fixed and random-effects models, with Hedges' estimating overall impact. Quality was assessed using AMSTAR-2, and statistical analyses were performed (SPSS 28). RESULTS: A total of nine SRs incorporating 14 RCTs were included, representing 26,881 participants aged 40 years or older. The pooled random-effects meta-analysis showed a statistically significant but modest improvement in MMSE scores (effect size: 0.16; 95% CI: 0.01-0.32). Heterogeneity was moderate (I(2) = 42.8%), and no publication bias was detected. Further analyses revealed no significant associations between treatment duration or dosage and cognitive outcomes, suggesting a threshold effect rather than a dose-response relationship. CONCLUSIONS: These findings support n3-PUFA supplementation as a complementary approach to lifestyle-based strategies for cognitive health, including diet, physical activity, sleep optimization, and cognitive training. While benefits appear modest, consistent effects across studies warrant further high-quality research and well-designed studies to strengthen clinical recommendations.	Nutrients	19/09/2025
10.1212/WNL.0000000000214177	Screening for Congenital Myasthenic Syndromes in Adults With Seronegative	Krenn M, Wagner M, Schuller H, Pugna I, Rath J, Zulehner G, Keritam O, Weng R, Koneczny I, Schiavo E, Damato V, Kleinveld VEA, Kiss C, Gold V, Quasthoff S, Masi G, O'Connor KC, Canning J, Waters PJ, Lenz D, Blüthner M, Pavlov M, Graf E, Winkelmann J, Löscher WN, Zimprich F, Cetin H	BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Myasthenia gravis (MG) is a disorder of the neuromuscular junction, typically associated with autoantibodies (Abs) that impair neuromuscular transmission. However, approximately 10% of cases are seronegative. Emerging evidence suggests that seronegative MG (SNMG) may be mimicked by hereditary conditions, particularly congenital myasthenic syndromes (CMSs), which require different treatments. In this study, we aimed to determine the proportion of CMS among patients diagnosed with SNMG. METHODS: We used whole-exome sequencing (WES) in adult patients (aged ≥18 years) diagnosed with SNMG who were enrolled at 3 Austrian tertiary neuromuscular centers between August 2022 and January 2024. Genetic testing was conducted in individuals who remained seronegative after comprehensive serologic testing to exclude Abs against (clustered) acetylcholine receptors, muscle-specific kinase, lipoprotein receptor-related protein 4, and voltage-gated calcium channels. Moreover, we aimed to analyze clinical and demographic factors associated with the likelihood of receiving a molecular diagnosis. RESULTS: A total of 50 patients with SNMG (35 [70%] female) were referred for exome-based genetic screening. The median age at disease onset was 35 years (interquartile range 24.0-46.0 years). Seven patients (14%) were genetically diagnosed with CMS through WES (4 with CHRNE and 3 with RAPSN variants). In addition, findings of uncertain clinical significance were reported in 4 cases, implicating CACNA1S, DOK7, DPAGT1, and RAPSN. Although patients with CMS tended to have a younger age at disease onset in univariate analysis (p = 0.04, r = 0.29), no clinical or demographic factors remained significantly associated with a molecular diagnosis after correction for multiple testing. Only 1 patient with a confirmed CMS diagnosis reported a positive family history. Six individuals with CMS (86%) had either received immunomodulatory treatments (n = 4) or undergone thymectomy (n = 4). Of the 4 patients with CMS receiving immunotherapies, 3 were reported to have experienced at least a partial response. DISCUSSION: Our findings provide evidence that a considerable proportion of patients diagnosed with SNMG have an underlying hereditary etiology. Notably, a (subjective) response to immunotherapies does not exclude a molecular CMS diagnosis. In conclusion, offering genetic testing to seronegative patients with myasthenic syndromes may have profound therapeutic implications.	Neurology	21/10/2025

We aimed to describe the results of surveillance of gonococcal AMR conducted globally by WHO and discuss the actions needed to retain our ability to treat gonorrhoea. METHODS: In this retrospective observational study, we present gonococcal AMR data reported to WHO by 77 countries between Jan 1, 2019, and Dec 31, 2022. Gonococcal isolates were tested for minimum inhibitory concentrations of one to four key antimicrobials (ceftriaxone, cefixime, azithromycin, and ciprofloxacin) in each country. We used breakpoints for resistance and decreased susceptibility to antimicrobials from the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing or Clinical Laboratory and Standards Institute. FINDINGS: 29 (39%) of 75 participating countries reported at least one isolate with resistance or decreased susceptibility to ceftriaxone, 28 (50%) of 56 reported resistance or decreased susceptibility to cefixime, 58 (88%) of 66 reported resistance to azithromycin, and 74 (99%) of 75 reported resistance to ciprofloxacin. Globally, azithromycin resistance is increasing, as is resistance or decreased susceptibility to ceftriaxone and cefixime, especially in the WHO Western Pacific region. Resistance to ciprofloxacin remained very high globally. Since 2017-18, the numbers of reporting countries, examined isolates, and resistant isolates have increased. However, surveillance levels remain inadequate in central America and the Caribbean, eastern Europe, and the WHO African, Eastern Mediterranean, and South-East Asia regions. INTERPRETATION: Global AMR surveillance conducted by WHO is expanding and, in selected countries, improving through standardisation and quality assurance, as well as implementation of extragenital sampling, test of cure, and whole-genome sequencing. This approach provides evidence-based data for management guidelines and public health policies. Improvements in prevention, early diagnosis, treatment of patients and their contacts, surveillance (of infection rates, AMR, treatment failures, and antimicrobial use), and antimicrobial stewardship are essential. WHO supports this work through several global action plans on AMR, new global gonorrhoea treatment recommendations, surveillance, and research. FUNDING: None.	The Lancet. Microbe	24/09/2025
10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2025.147928	Autophagic damage in senescent bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells: Impact on	Huang C, Chen X, Wu D, Chen J, Wang J, Li S, Hu J, Yan Z, Zhu Y, Zhang Y	Osteoporosis is a major health challenge, particularly in postmenopausal women. Bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells (BMSCs) are crucial for maintaining bone homeostasis by differentiating into osteoblasts and adipocytes. However, in the osteoporotic microenvironment, aging and estrogen deficiency lead to oxidative stress, impairing BMSC function and promoting senescence. Piezo1, a mechanosensitive calcium-permeable ion channel highly expressed in BMSCs, translates mechanical cues into pro-osteogenic signals. This study aimed to investigate the interplay between autophagy, Piezo1 expression, and BMSC senescence in osteoporosis, and explore the therapeutic potential of modulating the autophagy-Piezo1 axis. We observed that Piezo1 expression was downregulated in the bone tissues of patients with osteoporosis and ovariectomized (OVX) mice, accompanied by an increase in senescence-associated markers in BMSCs. Oxidative stress reduced Piezo1 expression and promoted BMSC senescence, shifting differentiation toward adipogenic rather than osteogenic lineages. Autophagic flux was impaired in senescent BMSCs, and activating autophagy via rapamycin restored Piezo1 expression, alleviated senescence, and rebalanced osteogenic/adipogenic differentiation. Mechanistically, inhibiting the mTOR/S6K pathway enhanced autophagy and Piezo1 expression. Rapamycin treatment increased bone mass and improved bone microarchitecture in OVX mice by promoting Piezo1 expression and suppressing senescence markers. Our findings highlight the critical role of autophagy in maintaining Piezo1 expression and BMSC function, suggesting that targeting the autophagy-Piezo1 axis may offer a novel therapeutic strategy for osteoporosis management.

Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) transplantation has the potential to alleviate periodontitis and restore alveolar bone, but numerous studies have found that transplanted MSCs undergo apoptosis, releasing apoptotic extracellular vesicles (ApoEVs). Human periodontal ligament stem cells (hPDLSCs) ApoEVs have immunomodulatory and tissue regenerative potential. Still, their role in periodontitis treatment and alveolar bone restoration has not been investigated yet. METHODS: The study isolated hPDLSCs-ApoEVs and investigated the modulatory effect on macrophaghe. We explored the specific molecular mechanisms of hPDLSC-ApoEVs in regulating macrophage polarization in vitro through mRNA-seq and inhibitors. Co-culture experiment demonstrated that hPDLSC-ApoEVs promoted hPDLSC osteogenic differentiation by regulating macrophage polarization. Finally, we verified that hPDLSC-ApoEVs inhibited periodontitis-induced periodontal tissue defects and promoted periodontal bone tissue regeneration in vivo.

Limited research has investigated the mechanisms by which skeletal muscle satellite cells (SMSCs) promote muscle regeneration and osteoporotic fracture healing. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of a traditional herbal decoction (HD), the Invigorate the Spleen and Tonify the Kidney Formula, on SMSC regulation, muscle regeneration, and fracture healing. METHOD: Using conditional knockout mice, the role of SMSCs in promoting fracture healing and mitigating sarcopenia was evaluated by visualizing the fracture area and surrounding muscle tissue. The signaling pathways involved were comprehensively analyzed using a combination of Western blotting, real-time PCR analysis, immunohistochemical staining, and immunofluorescent staining. And the key elements and compounds facilitating osteogenesis and myogenesis were identified using HPLC and network pharmacology analysis. RESULTS: This study demonstrated that the herbal decoction mediates the β-catenin signaling pathway, mobilizes SMSCs to migrate to the fracture area, facilitates their osteogenic and myogenic differentiation, and enhances osteoporotic fracture healing. Knockdown of β-catenin in SMSCs in Pax7-Cre(ERT2/+);β-catenin(fx/fx) conditional knockout mice led to sarcopenia and osteoporosis. Additionally, the herbal decoction significantly increased bone mass, repaired bone microstructure, and promoted muscle fiber remodeling around fractures in mice. CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide the first evidence that the HD, as a β-catenin agonist, not only promotes fracture healing by modulating the osteogenic and myogenic effects of SMSCs but also ameliorates sarcopenia. This study offers practical evidence supporting the formula as a promising therapeutic candidate for treating osteosarcopenic fractures.	Stem cell research & therapy	26/09/2025
10.1038/s41418-025-01587-4	AARS1-mediated lactylation of H3K18 and STAT1 promotes ferroptosis in diabetic	Hong J, Xu H, Yu L, Yu Z, Chen X, Meng Z, Zhu J, Li J, Zhu M	Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is the primary cause of end-stage renal disease worldwide. Recent studies have revealed that lactate-mediated histone lactylation, which functions as a novel epigenetic modification, is involved in the occurrence and development of diabetes-related complications. However, little is known about the role of lactyltransferase in DN. Alanyl-tRNA synthetase 1 (AARS1) was identified as a novel lactyltransferase that modulates histone H3-lysine-18 lactylation (H3K18la). In the present study, we determined whether AARS1-mediated H3K18la participates in the pathogenesis of DN. More importantly, we explored the potential mechanism involved. A mouse DN model consisting of both wild-type and alanyl-tRNA synthetase (AARS1) heterozygote (AARS1(+/-)) mice was utilized in this study. Transcriptomic and lipidomic analyses, combined with a variety of molecular biological methodologies, were employed to elucidate the potential mechanism by which AARS1 regulates ferroptosis in DN. Our results indicated that the increases in AARS1 and H3K18la expression were involved in kidney dysfunction and renal cell death via the modulation of ferroptosis in the DN model. Moreover, AARS1 induced lipid peroxidation by increasing fatty acid elongase-5 (ELOVL5) transcription, ultimately contributing to ferroptosis induction. Furthermore, AARS1 interacted with signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) to jointly regulate ELOVL5 transcription. Additionally, treatment with the STAT1-specific inhibitor fludarabine delayed DN progression. In addition, we observed that AARS1 modulated the lactylation of both STAT1 and H3K18 to regulate ELOVL5 transcription, thus triggering ferroptosis. Inhibition of AARS1-induced lactylation via β-alanine attenuated ferroptosis in DN model mice and hyperglycaemic cells. The present study showed that AARS1 induced the lactylation of H3K18 and STAT1 to regulate ELOVL5 transcription, thus triggering ferroptosis in a diabetic nephropathy model.

Despite this, the impact of menopause on MS disease trajectory remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: To assess whether menopause modifies the risk of disability progression for women with relapse-onset MS. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective cohort study used prospective clinical data that were collected within the MSBase Registry. Data were extracted from MSBase on July 1, 2023. These data were analyzed from January 2023 through February 2025. Female participants were recruited from 8 Australian neuroimmunology specialist centers (1 private practice and 7 tertiary referral centers) from 2018 through 2021. Participants included 1468 women aged 18 years or older who completed dedicated retrospective women's health surveys. Of these, 987 women with relapse-onset MS, 3 or more Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) measurements recorded, and reported menopausal status were included in the primary analysis. The secondary analysis included 209 women with 1 or more EDSS measurements recorded in the MSBase database predate and postdate of menopause onset. EXPOSURE: Crude and adjusted Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess the impact of menopause, modeled as a time-varying covariate, on progressive disability milestones. Analyses were adjusted for age at MS onset, baseline disease duration, baseline EDSS score, baseline relapse, and exposure to high-efficacy disease-modifying therapy modeled as a time-varying covariate. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: In the primary analysis, the main outcome was time to 6-month confirmed disability progression (CDP). The secondary outcome was time to secondary progressive MS (SPMS). The secondary inflection point analysis examined longitudinal changes in EDSS in women who were followed up with throughout their menopausal transition. RESULTS: Primary analysis included 583 premenopausal and 404 postmenopausal women with MS. The median age at menopause was 48.5 years. Following multivariable adjustment, menopause was not associated with an increased risk of CDP or SPMS (hazard ratio, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.70-1.29; P = .70 and hazard ratio, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.60-1.67; P = 1.00), respectively. In the secondary analysis, menopause did not represent an inflection point in EDSS worsening following multivariable adjustment. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: While reproductive aging may be additive to the effects of somatic aging, these results do not support menopause as the leading factor for disability progression in older women with MS.

In this study, we quantitatively profiled serum metabolites of participants in 2 independent cohorts. Based on the data from cohort 1 (22 AD patients, 19 MCI patients and 19 cognitively normal participants (CN)), we identified 32 differential metabolites in AD and 49 in MCI serum. Notably, differential metabolites related to amino acid (AA), organic acid, fatty acid (FA), phosphatidylcholine (PC), sphingomyelin (SM) metabolism in AD and free fatty acid (FFA), acylcarnitine, PC, SM in MCI were strongly associated with cognitive level, memory, attention and execution function as evaluated by cognitive scales. Pathway analysis based on the differential metabolites revealed perturbation in pathways related to phospholipid metabolism, sphingolipid metabolism, AAs metabolism, beta oxidation of FAs, and carnitine metabolism. Using random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM) and Boruta analysis for classification and validated by gradient boosting (GB), logistic regression (LR) and RF diagnostic model, we identified panels of 10 metabolites in AD and 13 metabolites in MCI that effectively discriminate AD and MCI individuals from CN with high accuracy, sensitivity and specificity. The diagnostic accuracy of the models was further validated in an independent cohort 2, consisting of 20 AD, 20 MCI and 20 CN individuals, with consistent results.

Their pre-analytical stability requires scrutiny. This study assessed pre-analytical effects to inform a standardized sample handling protocol. METHODS: Assessed pre-analytical variations included collection tube type, hemolysis, centrifugation settings, centrifugation/storage delays, tube transfers, and freeze-thawing (n = 15/experiment). Phosphorylated tau (pTau) isoforms were measured with Simoa, Lumipulse, MesoScale Discovery, and immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry. Amyloid-beta (Aβ42, Aβ40), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and neurofilament light (NfL) protein were measured with Simoa. RESULTS: All assessed BBM levels varied by over 10% by collection tube type. Aβ peptides were the most sensitive, and their levels declined >by more than 10% under storage and centrifugation delays, more steeply at room temperature (RT) compared with 2°C to 8°C. NfL and GFAP levels increased by more than 10% upon RT/-20°C storage. pTau isoforms demonstrated stability across most pre-analytical variations. DISCUSSION: We established an evidence-based handling protocol to ensure reliable sample handling for neurological BBMs upon adoption in clinics, trials, and research. HIGHLIGHTS: Sample handling protocols can mitigate pre-analytical effects on BBM results. We developed an evidence-based, expert-consensus plasma sample handling protocol. Primary collection tube and delays to centrifuging or freezing impact AD BBMs. Plasma pTau217 is highly resistant to pre-analytical sample handling variations. Plasma Aβ42 and Aβ40 were most sensitive to pre-analytical variations.	Alzheimer's & dementia : the journal of the Alzheimer's Association	01/10/2025

Elevated levels of fetal hemoglobin (HbF) in adulthood reduce disease severity. A promising therapy involves the treatment of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) with CRISPR-Cas9 to downregulate the HbF repressor BCL11A via generation of double-strand breaks (DSBs) in the +58-kb enhancer. To improve safety and HbF induction, we use base editors to target both the +58-kb and +55-kb enhancers without generating DSBs. We dissect key DNA motifs recognized by transcriptional activators and identify critical nucleotides. Multiplex base editing efficiently disrupts these sites, reactivating HbF to levels exceeding those achieved with CRISPR-Cas9-induced editing, while minimizing DSBs and genomic rearrangements. Base editing is effective in long-term repopulating HSPCs and results in robust HbF reactivation in vivo. These findings demonstrate that multiplex base editing of BCL11A enhancers is a safe, efficient, and durable strategy to treat SCD.	Cell reports. Medicine	26/09/2025

This review evaluated existing AI algorithms for extracting facial information during social interaction assessments and contributing to diagnostic accuracy for ASD assessment and response to therapy. METHODS: Systematic review of studies on human participants with an ASD diagnosis, sourced from Medline, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, IEEE Xplore, and ACM Digital Library, evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of AI algorithms in ASD classification and their use in tracking social development through facial information for clinical application in social interactions. Bivariate and multi-level models addressed dependencies, heterogeneity, moderators (modalities, algorithms, tasks), and applied robust variance estimation. Publication bias was evaluated with funnel plots. The QUADAS-2 tool assessed the risk of bias and applicability. This study was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42021249905). FINDINGS: Of 40,570 studies identified, 38 met the review criteria, and seven provided sufficient data for meta-analysis. The pooled diagnostic odds ratio of 15.917 (95% CI [4.775-53.059]), and bivariate analysis estimated an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.862. Accuracy improved with facial features, unstructured play, support vector machines, and decision tree-based algorithms. AI methods can analyse social behaviours, including eye gaze on social stimuli, emotional expression, and joint attention in ASD assessments.	EBioMedicine	26/09/2025

As the global prevalence of obesity continues to rise, the burden of MASLD/MASH is increasing, posing significant challenges to healthcare systems. The use of anti-obesity medications (AOMs) in this population is complex due to altered hepatic metabolism, safety concerns, and potential hepatotoxicity. Recent advances in pharmacologic agents, such as glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs), dual GLP-1/glucose-gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP) agonists, and triple GLP-1/GIP/glucagon agonists, have shown promising metabolic effects in the general population.

NF1 gene replacement therapy, though promising, is hindered by NF1 gene's large size and delivery challenges. We introduced a membrane-targeted, truncated neurofibromin comprising the GAP-related domain (GRD) fused to the KRAS4B C-terminal domain, which effectively inhibits the RAS signaling pathway and restores Schwann cell differentiation in an NF1 iPSC-derived model. For systemic application, we engineered an adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector using in vivo capsid evolution through sequential DNA shuffling and peptide library screening in a NF1 xenograft mouse model. This tailored vector, AAV-NF, exhibits greatly reduced liver uptake, enhanced tumor targeting across various NF1-related MPNST, neurofibromas and glioma models, and therapeutic efficacy in xenografts of MPNST. This study not only advances a viable AAV vector for NF1 treatment but also outlines a replicable strategy for vector and payload development in other monogenic and tumor-associated disease manifestations.

A long-standing hypothesis is that timely resolution of G4s is needed for efficient and faithful DNA replication. In vitro, G4s may be unwound by helicases or alternatively resolved via DNA2 nuclease mediated G4 cleavage. However, little is known about the biological significance and regulatory mechanism of the DNA2-mediated G4 removal pathway. Here, we report that DNA2 deficiency or its chemical inhibition leads to a significant accumulation of G4s and stalled replication forks at telomeres, which is demonstrated by a high-resolution technology: Single molecular analysis of replicating DNA (SMARD). We further identify that the DNA repair complex MutSα (MSH2-MSH6) binds G4s and stimulates G4 resolution via DNA2-mediated G4 excision. MSH2 deficiency, like DNA2 deficiency or inhibition, causes G4 accumulation and defective telomere replication. Meanwhile, G4-stabilizing environmental compounds block G4 unwinding by helicases but not G4 cleavage by DNA2. Consequently, G4 stabilizers impair telomere replication and cause telomere instabilities, especially in cells deficient in DNA2 or MSH2.	Nature communications	26/09/2025
10.1016/j.reprotox.2025.109073	Exploring potential mechanisms of artificial sweeteners in polycystic ovary	He H, Lyu Y, Fu M, Jiang X, Liu J, Xiao M	Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a complex endocrine and metabolic disorder increasingly prevalent among women of reproductive age. Artificial sweeteners, commonly used as sugar substitutes, are now under scrutiny for their potential disruption of metabolic and hormonal equilibrium. This investigation delves into the molecular mechanisms through which seven artificial sweeteners (aspartame, saccharin, sucralose, acesulfame-K, sodium cyclamate, neotame, and alitame) may impact the development of PCOS. By employing network toxicology and molecular docking methodologies, we identified 85 common targets shared between genes associated with sweeteners and those linked to PCOS. Enrichment analyses using Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways unveiled connections to inflammation, insulin resistance, and steroid biosynthesis, particularly implicating pathways such as TNF signaling, AGE-RAGE signaling, and the AMPK pathway. Notably, key targets like TNF, STAT3, and IFNG displayed high binding affinities with artificial sweeteners in molecular docking simulations. These results suggest a potential role for artificial sweeteners in exacerbating PCOS progression through inflammatory and metabolic pathways, underscoring the need for further experimental validation.

SNCA, the gene encoding for the protein alpha-synuclein (aSyn), was the first to be associated with familial forms of PD and, since then, several missense variants and multiplications of the gene have been established as rare causes of autosomal dominant forms of PD. In this study, we report the identification of a novel SNCA mutation in a patient that presented with a complex neurogenerative disorder, and unconventional neuropathological findings. We also performed in depth molecular studies of the effects of the novel aSyn mutation. METHODS: A patient carrying the novel aSyn missense mutation and the family members were studied. We present the clinical features, genetic testing-whole exome sequencing (WES), and neuropathological findings. The functional consequences of this aSyn variant were extensively investigated using biochemical, biophysical, and cellular assays. RESULTS: The patient exhibited a complex neurodegenerative disease that included generalized myocloni, bradykinesia, dystonia of the left arm and apraxia. WES identified a novel heterozygous SNCA variant (cDNA 40G > A; protein G14R). Neuropathological examination showed extensive atypical aSyn pathology with frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD)-type distribution and nigral degeneration pattern with abundant ring-like neuronal inclusions, and few oligodendroglial inclusions. Sanger sequencing confirmed the SNCA variant in one healthy, 86-year-old parent of the patient suggesting incomplete penetrance. NMR studies suggest that the G14R mutation induces a local structural alteration in aSyn, and lower thioflavin T binding in in vitro fibrillization assays. Interestingly, the G14R aSyn fibers display different fibrillar morphologies than Lewy bodies as revealed by cryo-electron microscopy. Cellular studies of the G14R variant revealed increased inclusion formation, enhanced membrane association, and impaired dynamic reversibility of serine-129 phosphorylation. CONCLUSIONS: The atypical neuropathological features observed, which are reminiscent of those observed for the G51D aSyn variant, suggest a causal role of the SNCA variant with a distinct clinical and pathological phenotype, which is further supported by the properties of the mutant aSyn.

10.1007/s00204-025-04206-w	cGAS-STING and autophagy: crosstalk, molecular mechanisms, and targeted therapy.	Wang Y, Wu S, Zhang X, Zheng W, Wang Z, Zhang J, Chen J, Wang H	The cytosolic DNA-sensing cGAS-STING pathway and autophagy represent two evolutionarily conserved systems critical for innate immunity and cellular homeostasis. The cGAS-STING pathway detects mislocalized DNA, triggering inflammation via interferon and cytokine production. Conversely, autophagy maintains equilibrium by degrading damaged organelles and pathogens. Crucially, these systems engage in reciprocal regulation: autophagy constrains cGAS-STING hyperactivity through lysosomal degradation of immunostimulatory DNA and STING itself, while cGAS-STING signaling induces autophagy via TBK1-mediated phosphorylation of autophagy adaptors to mitigate self-damage. Dysregulation of this interplay drives pathology. For instance, defective autophagy in systemic lupus erythematosus permits mitochondrial DNA accumulation and cGAS-driven interferonopathy, whereas persistent STING activation in cancers suppresses autophagic tumor surveillance. This review aims to dissect the molecular mechanisms underpinning their crosstalk, delineate its disruption in autoimmune, neurodegenerative, and oncological diseases, and critically evaluate emerging therapies designed to pharmacologically rebalance this axis. These include combining cGAS-STING inhibitors with autophagy enhancers to suppress inflammation in interferonopathies, and pairing STING agonists with autophagy inducers to potentiate antitumor immunity.By synthesizing preclinical and clinical advances, we establish a framework for developing context-specific therapeutics that exploit the cGAS-STING-autophagy circuit-translating mechanistic insights into precision treatments for immune dysregulation disorders.

Yet the origin and functional heterogeneity of pericytes in the most common malignant brain tumor glioblastoma (GBM) remain unclear. Here, single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) is performed on CD146(+) pericytes from human primary GBMs. Tumor- and normal-originated pericytes (T-PCs and N-PCs) that have distinctive cell-intrinsic features and intercellular communications with endothelial and immune cells are identified. Bioinformatic analyses on integrated in-house and public scRNA-seq data have found a T-PC metacluster marked by CD44 closely associated with tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). The CD44(High) pericytes are detected in human GBM samples and glioma-stem-cell (GSC)-derived pericytes. Coimplantation of GSC-derived CD44(High) pericytes promotes M2 polarization of TAMs and growth of orthotopic GBMs. In summary, this study unravels the existence of T-PCs and N-PCs in GBMs, analyzes their functional heterogeneity, and unravels the immunoregulatory roles of CD44(High) pericytes. These discoveries help to gain insights into brain tumor vasculature and inspire therapeutic strategies targeting vessels and TAMs for GBM treatment.

Targeting ferroptosis emerges as a promising strategy to enhance immunotherapy efficacy, prompting our investigation of antiplatelet agents that simultaneously promote ferroptosis and mitigate thromboembolic risks. Through systematic screening of 20 Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved antiplatelet agents, we identify vorapaxar as a potent pro-ferroptotic drug. Mechanistically, vorapaxar binds forkhead box O1 (FOXO1), inhibits its phosphorylation at Ser256, and facilitates nuclear translocation to upregulate heme oxygenase 1 (HMOX1), promoting mitochondrial iron overload and mitochondria-associated ferroptosis. Vorapaxar enhances immunotherapy-induced tumor ferroptosis and antitumor immunity across diverse melanoma models, including B16F10 tumor-bearing mice, Braf/Pten-driven spontaneous melanoma mice, and peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC)-humanized mice. Clinically, high FOXO1/HMOX1 co-expression correlates with improved immunotherapy response and progression-free survival. These findings position vorapaxar as a promising adjunct to immunotherapy, offering a dual benefit for cancer patients requiring both antithrombotic therapy and immunotherapy.	Cell reports.

Here we investigate the relationships between air pollutants and TAAD incidence. In a Cox's proportional hazards model, hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals) of TAAD for an interquartile range increase in air pollutants were 2.15 (1.96, 2.35) for particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter ≤2.5 μm (PM(2.5); per 2.15 μg m(-3) increase), 1.76 (1.61, 1.92) for PM(10) (per 2.99 μg m(-3) increase), 1.45 (1.34, 1.58) for NO(2) (per 6.97 μg m(-3) increase) and 1.40 (1.29, 1.51) for NO(x) (per 11.58 μg m(-3) increase). These estimates remained consistent when using inverse probability weighting and generalized propensity score methods. Furthermore, this study revealed potential joint effects and interactions between air pollutants and genetic susceptibility on TAAD risk, especially the multiplicative and additive interactions between PM(2.5) and genetic susceptibility. Air pollution exposure is associated with an increased TAAD risk and genetic susceptibility modifies this association.	Nature cardiovascular research	26/09/2025
10.1186/s13098-025-01949-5	Mediation of fasting blood glucose between relative muscle strength and	Wang P, Huang L, Zhu Z, Hu X, Wu B, Yang X	BACKGROUND: Hypertension and type 2 diabetes are major global health burdens and often coexist due to shared metabolic risk factors. Relative muscle strength (RMS), a composite measure of muscle function, shows an inverse association with hypertension. The mechanisms underlying this link remain unclear. Elevated fasting blood glucose (FBG) reflects impaired glucose metabolism and insulin resistance and is associated with both reduced muscle strength and higher blood pressure. This suggests that FBG may partly mediate the RMS-hypertension relationship. Yet, large-scale population studies have rarely tested this mediating pathway, leaving an important knowledge gap. METHODS: We analyzed data from two nationally representative cohorts: NHANES (2011-2014;adults aged ≥ 18 Years, mean age 48 years ) and CHARLS (2011-2012; adults aged ≥ 45 Years, mean age 58 years). Hypertension prevalence was nearly 30.0% in NHANES and 42.1% in CHARLS. RMS was calculated as grip strength divided by appendicular skeletal muscle mass (ASM). Hypertension was defined as systolic/diastolic blood pressure ≥ 140/90 mmHg or self-reported diagnosis. Logistic regression examined the RMS-hypertension associations, and causal mediation analysis quantified fasting glucose's mediating role, and restricted cubic spline models were applied to explore potential non-linear relationship. RESULTS: In NHANES (n = 9,652; Hypertension prevalence 30.0%), RMS was inversely associated with hypertension across quartiles (Q2-Q4 vs. Q1: adjusted ORs (95% CIs) of 0.82, 0.78, and 0.72, respectively). Mediation analysis showed fasting glucose partially mediated this association, accounting for 13.1% of this association. In CHARLS (n = 12,946; Hypertension prevalence 42.1%), similar trends were observed (Q2-Q4 vs. Q1: adjusted ORs (95% CIs) 0.91, 0.76, and 0.66), But fasting glucose partially mediated this association, explaining only 2.0% of the association. Restricted cubic spline models revealed significant nonlinearity in CHARLS (P < 0.001) but not in NHANES (P = 0.921). CONCLUSION: This study is the first to examine the partially mediating role of fasting blood glucose in the RMS-hypertension relationship across diverse populations. RMS was consistently associated with lower hypertension risk, with varying degrees of glucose mediation between cohorts. These findings support integrating RMS assessment into cardiovascular risk screening and highlight muscle strength as a potential target for non-pharmacological prevention. Given the cross-sectional nature of this study, longitudinal research is needed to clarify causal pathways and inform public health strategies.	Diabetology & metabolic syndrome	26/09/2025

PCD is associated with early-onset chronic wet cough and rhinosinusitis, laterality defects, middle ear disease, and reduced fertility. The clinical presentation is heterogeneous, and diagnosis often relies on multiple tests. The American Thoracic Society (ATS) and European Respiratory Society (ERS) have previously developed separate guidelines for diagnosis. Here, ERS and ATS members systematically reviewed the literature on diagnostic tools used in practice and developed unified evidence-based guidelines for PCD diagnosis using GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations) methodology, and a transparent process of decision-making using Evidence-to-Decision (EtD) frameworks. The Task Force panel formulated three PICO (Patients, Intervention, Comparison, Outcomes) questions and three narrative questions. The accuracies of high-speed video microscopy (HSVM), immunofluorescence (IF), and nasal nitric oxide (nNO) were compared to a reference test of transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and/or genetics. The panel gives strong recommendation for use of HSVM, IF, and nNO as adjunct tests to TEM and/or genetics for PCD diagnosis. However, no adjunct test is suitable as a standalone test to diagnose PCD and no single adjunct or reference test is suitable to exclude PCD. Pursuing a genetic diagnosis is encouraged due to the implication on management. The panel emphasizes that tests should meet a minimum standard and proposes evaluation of patients at a referral centre experienced in diagnosis. The pretest probability based on symptoms should be considered when interpreting results.	The European respiratory journal	26/09/2025
10.1016/j.kint.2025.08.030	Critical role of transcription factor SOX4 in tubular epithelial cell	Du H, Jiao B, Xing J, Yang D, Tran M, Wang P, Hu Z, Lefebvre V, Zhou D, Wang Y	INTRODUCTION: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a widely prevalent health issue globally. A striking pathological feature of CKD is kidney fibrosis characterized by excessive production and deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM). Tubular epithelial cell (TEC) dedifferentiation and fibroblast activation contribute to the pathogenesis of kidney fibrosis. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying TEC dedifferentiation and fibroblast activation are not fully understood. Here, we investigated the role of SRY-box transcription factor 4 (SOX4) in regulating TEC dedifferentiation and fibroblast activation during the development of CKD. METHODS: We generated global, TEC-specific, and fibroblast-specific SOX4 knockout mice. These mice were subjected to three preclinical models of kidney fibrosis induced by unilateral ureteral obstruction, ischemia-reperfusion injury, or high-dose folic acid to examine the role of SOX4 in TEC dedifferentiation and fibroblast activation during the development of kidney fibrosis. Cultured TECs and fibroblasts were employed to determine the role and molecular mechanisms of SOX4 in regulating TEC dedifferentiation and fibroblast activation in vitro. RESULTS: SOX4 was induced in the injured kidneys but its deficiency inhibits TEC dedifferentiation, fibroblast activation and further impeded the development of kidney fibrosis in mice. In vitro, knockdown of SOX4 preserved the epithelial phenotype and inhibited fibroblast activation induced by transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1). Mechanistically, SOX4 facilitated the TGF-β1-Smad3 signaling pathway to promote TEC dedifferentiation and fibroblast activation. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings identify SOX4 as a critical factor in TEC dedifferentiation and fibroblast activation suggesting SOX4 may serve as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of CKD.

10.1002/advs.202505469	Gut Microbial Genetic Variation Prolongs Host Healthy Longevity and Remodels	Wang L, Yang Z, Pang Y, Wu X, Zhang X, Zhu T, Ding X, Liu W, Zhou Y, Zhang P, Li Y, Zhu Z	Microbial genetic variation plays a crucial role in shaping host-microbe interactions; however, its impact on healthy aging remains largely unexplored. This study investigates how genetic variations in gut-residing Saccharomyces cerevisiae affect the health and lifespan of Drosophila melanogaster. This study identifies 14 yeast mutants that significantly extended the lifespan of D. melanogaster, with 13 mutants enhancing locomotor function in aged flies and two mutants improving reproductive capacity. Metabolomic and proteomic analyses reveal that these mutant yeasts rejuvenate the metabolic state of the aging gut and alter protein levels in tissues outside the gut. Most of the proteins with at least a two-fold change are upregulated. The data also highlights mitochondrial energy metabolism as a key anti-aging mechanism driven by the yeast. Notably, terpenoid metabolites such as ergosterol acetate showed strong lifespan-extending effects and may influence energy metabolism. In conclusion, these findings establish a strong link between gut metabolic status and healthy aging, underscoring the significance of the microbial-host mitochondrial axis as a key mechanism by which gut microbes promote host health and longevity. Furthermore, genetically engineered probiotics in model organisms offer a promising potential strategy for extending healthy lifespan, thus meriting further investigation in translational research models.

Sensitivity to ferroptosis is expected to vary in different organelles. To monitor in real time the onset and progression of lipid peroxidation in ferroptosis, here we report lipophilic fluorogenic radical-trapping antioxidants, embedding in endoplasmic reticulum, lysosomes, mitochondria and plasma membrane. We show that endoplasmic reticulum- and lysosome-embedding fluorogenic radical-trapping antioxidants are most effective in protecting from cell death. The onset of lipid peroxidation happens in the endoplasmic reticulum, with lipid hydroperoxide accumulating in Golgi-associated vesicles. Disintegration of these structures spreads lipid hydroperoxide intracellularly, acting as 'free radical embers'. Outwards migration of oxidized lipids to plasma membrane, the ultimate sink for oxidized lipids, was recorded. Our results underscore Golgi-associated structures as a site to regulate ferroptosis progression. The work further positions fluorogenic radical-trapping antioxidants as valuable tools for unravelling the dynamic subcellular progression of ferroptosis.	Nature chemistry	26/09/2025

10.3390/ijms26189044	Gulf War Illness, Fibromyalgia, Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue	Mantle D, Domingo JC, Golomb BA, Castro-Marrero J	Although Gulf War Illness (GWI), fibromyalgia (FM), myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) and long COVID have distinct origins, in this article we have reviewed evidence that these disorders comprise a group of so-called low-energy associated disorders with overlapping common symptoms underlying pathology. In particular, evidence for mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, inflammation, immune dysregulation, neuroendocrine dysfunction, disrupted brain-gut-microbiome axis, apoptosis/ferroptosis and telomere shortening as common features in the pathogenesis of these disorders has been identified. Given the role of coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) in promoting normal mitochondrial function, as an antioxidant, antiinflammatory and antiapoptotic and antiferroptotic agent, there is a rationale for supplementary CoQ10 in the management of these disorders. The reported benefits of supplementary CoQ10 administration in GWI, FM, ME/CFS and long COVID have been reviewed; the potential benefit of supplementary CoQ10 in reducing telomere shortening and improving the efficiency of stem cell transfer relevant has also been identified as promising therapeutic strategies in these disorders. This review advances beyond previous systematic reviews and consensus statements on overlapping similar symptoms and underlying biological pathomechanisms in these complex disorders.

The clinical (splenomegaly), abdominal ultrasonographic (splenic hypo-echogenic lesions) and computed tomographic (splenic hypo-dense lesions) elements lead to a splenic disorder, but the association of intra-thoracic and intra-abdominal adenopathies(CT revealed) raises suspicion of a chronic lymphoproliferative syndrome. Splenectomy by open approach is performed and the surprise comes from histopathology: splenic tuberculosis.

To identify new drugs and drug targets for hypnozoites, we screened the Repurposing, Focused Rescue, and Accelerated Medchem (ReFRAME) library and a collection of epigenetic inhibitors against P. vivax liver stages. From both libraries, we identified inhibitors targeting epigenetics pathways as selectively active against P. vivax and P. cynomolgi hypnozoites. These include DNA methyltransferase inhibitors as well as several inhibitors targeting histone post-translational modifications. Immunofluorescence staining of Plasmodium liver forms showed strong nuclear 5-methylcystosine signal, indicating liver stage parasite DNA is methylated. Using bisulfite sequencing, we mapped genomic DNA methylation in sporozoites, revealing DNA methylation signals in most coding genes. We also demonstrated that methylation level in proximal promoter regions as well as in the first exon of the genes may affect, at least partially, gene expression in P. vivax. The importance of selective inhibitors targeting epigenetic features on hypnozoites was validated using MMV019721, an acetyl-CoA synthetase inhibitor that affects histone acetylation and was previously reported as active against P. falciparum blood stages. In summary, our data indicate that several epigenetic mechanisms are likely modulating hypnozoite formation or persistence and provide an avenue for the discovery and development of improved radical cure antimalarials.	eLife	30/09/2025

The extensive body of evidence supporting the application of this clinical genomics approach in pediatric patients stands in stark contrast to the relative paucity of evidence for its use in the adult population. Here, we describe the largest cohort to date of adult patients who underwent clinical exome and genome sequencing for suspected genetic diagnoses. METHODS: A total of 2763 adult patients (2529 families) from all regions of Saudi Arabia are included in this cohort (2202 exomes, and 561 genomes). RESULTS: The diagnostic rate is 38.9% spanning 535 Mendelian genes and revealing clinical diagnostic errors in 38% of patients with positive reports. Structured feedback using C-GUIDE demonstrates clinical utility in 90% of positive cases. Consistent with the highly consanguineous nature of the local population, the majority (61%) of diagnosed phenotypes are recessive (94.6% homozygous) and founder variants account for 85% (414/487) of these variants. The same population characteristic has also led to the encounter of extremely rare, even novel recessive disorders including a highly penetrant novel RNF43-related hemochromatosis, NFXL1-related syndrome of hyperlaxity, short stature, and kidney disease, as well as autosomal recessive forms of typically dominant disorders. Multilocus phenotypes are observed in 5% of cases although only 26.7% of these are caused by two recessive variants. That 70% of molecular diagnoses encountered in our cohort are typically described in pediatric patients allowed us to observe highly unusual clinical presentations in the adult population. This delayed diagnosis also represents a missed opportunity for effective treatment in many instances and we note the availability of treatment for 26% of diagnosed conditions. Of particular interest are patients with monogenic disorders that could be overlooked as common multifactorial adult diseases (e.g., diabetes, dyslipidemia, stroke, chronic kidney disease, and dementia). Finally, we note the opportunities of deploying adult clinical genomics in an underrepresented population where 45.5% (373/819) of encountered variants are completely absent in gnomAD. CONCLUSIONS: Our results illustrate numerous benefits of a clinical genomics approach in adult medicine and argue for a broader implementation than currently practiced.	Genome medicine	29/09/2025

OBJECTIVE: To explore the safety, efficacy and immunological mechanisms of the novel edition of oncolytic virus vaccination, VG161, a multiarmed oncolytic herpes simplex virus-1 expressing interleukin (IL)-12, IL-15 and a programmed death-ligand 1 antagonist, in patients with advanced ICC. DESIGN: This pooled analysis integrates data from two multicentre clinical studies: a Phase I dose-escalation study and a Phase IIa exploratory study. 24 patients with advanced ICC received ultrasound-guided intratumoral injections of VG161. Multiomics analyses were performed on longitudinal tumour biopsies to evaluate immune modulation. RESULTS: The oncolytic virus therapy VG161 was well tolerated and showed encouraging antitumour activity, including improved overall survival versus second-line FOLFOX chemotherapy, even though most patients received VG161 as third-line or later therapy. Notably, patients previously treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors (CPIs) experienced enhanced benefit. Multiomics profiling of longitudinal biopsies revealed significant remodelling of the immunosuppressive tumour microenvironment, with proliferated infiltration of antigen-presenting cells, CD8(+) T cell activation and M2-like macrophage depletion. Single-cell and spatial transcriptomics identified epithelial and macrophage subpopulations (Epi-C2 and Macro-C1QC) as potential biomarkers of response and resistance. CONCLUSION: These early-phase findings suggest that VG161 elicits meaningful immune activation in ICC and supports further investigation. By inducing both direct oncolysis and multilayered immune activation, VG161 shows clinical benefit in a heavily pretreated population and holds promise for integration with	Gut	29/09/2025
10.1007/s12223-025-01345-6	β-Glucan in antiviral defense: mechanisms, immune modulation, and therapeutic	Atoom AM, Abdulsahib WK, Jyothi SR, Nayak PP, Chauhan AS, Singla S, Polatova D, Sead FF, Yazdi F	β-Glucans, naturally occurring β-D-glucose polysaccharides from fungi, yeast, bacteria, algae, and cereals, have emerged as promising immunomodulatory agents in antiviral defense. Their structural diversity-encompassing β-1,3, β-1,6, and β-1,4 linkages-underpins varied solubility, bioavailability, and biological activity, driving their therapeutic potential. Unlike conventional antivirals that target viral replication, β-glucans enhance host immunity by activating innate and adaptive responses through receptors such as dectin-1, toll-like receptors, and complement receptor 3, thereby stimulating macrophages, neutrophils, and natural killer cells to produce antiviral cytokines (e.g., interferons, interleukins) and induce trained immunity for long-term protection. This review explores β-glucans's mechanisms in combating viral infections, including SARS-CoV-2, HPV, HBV, influenza, and HIV, highlighting direct antiviral effects (e.g., inhibiting viral entry via sulfated derivatives), immune modulation (e.g., enhancing T-cell responses and antibody production), and inflammation control (e.g., mitigating cytokine storms). Preclinical and clinical evidence underscores their ability to reduce viral load, enhance vaccine efficacy, and support tissue repair, as seen in HPV-related lesions. β-Glucans also modulate the gut microbiota, bolstering mucosal immunity. Despite promising outcomes, challenges like structural heterogeneity and limited large-scale trials persist. This article outlines the therapeutic prospects of β-glucans, emphasizing their potential as safe and versatile adjuncts to address emerging viral threats and enhance global health resilience.

In colorectal cancer (CRC), TAM heterogeneity challenges macrophage-targeted therapies, with certain antitumor macrophage subpopulations not yet fully characterized. This study bridges this gap by identifying a distinct subset of tumoricidal CD169(+) macrophages. Increased infiltration of CD169(+) macrophages was observed in CRC tissues, which was significantly associated with improved overall survival in patients with CRC. Deleting CD169(+) macrophages in genetically engineered mouse models (MC38 orthotopic/ectopic and CD169(DTR/+)Apc(Min/+) intestinal adenoma) accelerated tumor growth. Integrated multi-omics data and functional assays, including cell coculture models and animal experiments with antibody blockade, reveal an antitumor mechanism in which CD169(+) macrophages directly interact with CRC cells. This interaction, mediated by CD169/CD43 molecular engagements, leads to tumor cell apoptosis via high levels of factor-related apoptosis ligand (FasL). Our results not only deepen our understanding of the CRC tumor microenvironment but also open avenues for cancer immunotherapy targeting.	Cell reports	26/09/2025
10.1007/s00059-023-05179-1	Refined risk stratification, current treatment, and new therapeutic approaches in	Lange TJ	The 2022 European Society of Cardiology/European Respiratory Society (ESC/ERS) guidelines for pulmonary hypertension have introduced a refined risk stratification to guide both initial and subsequent treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). The risk stratification at PAH diagnosis still comprises three risk categories (low, intermediate, high) and lists some new parameters. As the estimated 1‑year mortality is more than 20% in high-risk patients after diagnosis, an initial triple-combination therapy including parenteral prostacyclin analogues is recommended for this group. All other patients should receive a dual-combination therapy with an endothelin receptor antagonist and a phosphodiesterase‑5 inhibitor. However, this approach of initial combination therapy is only recommended for classic PAH, while monotherapy followed by regular follow-up and individualized therapy should be used for patients with cardiopulmonary comorbidities. For PAH patients without cardiopulmonary comorbidities, it is recommended to assess their risk at follow-up with a new 4‑strata classification, where the intermediate-risk group is split on the basis of three noninvasive parameters. Importantly, changes from intermediate-high to intermediate-low risk have been shown to be associated with a better prognosis. In addition, the recommendations on treatment escalation became more precise with the addition of a prostacyclin receptor agonist or switching a phosphodiesterase‑5 inhibitor to a soluble guanylate cyclase stimulator for intermediate-low risk and proceeding to triple-combination therapy with parenteral prostacyclin analogues already for intermediate-high risk. With sotatercept, the first non-vasodilator PAH treatment will become available in the near future to further enrich our treatment options for this chronic and still severe disease.	Herz	01/08/2023

Here, we identify a nonenzymatic role for BVRA in redox regulation. Through phylogenetic, genetic, biochemical, and enzymatic assays, we found that BVRA exerts critical nonenzymatic antioxidant activity. Transcriptomic analyses further revealed that BVRA physically and genetically interacts with nuclear factor erythroid-derived factor-like 2 (NRF2), a major transcriptional regulator of cellular redox signaling. ChIP-seq and RNA-seq analyses reveal that BVRA and NRF2 coordinate the expression of antioxidant genes, many of which are typically dysregulated in neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's disease.

Multiple small randomized clinical trials showed that a combination of budesonide with surfactant compared with surfactant alone reduced BPD or death. OBJECTIVE: To determine if early intratracheal administration of a combination of budesonide (0.25 mg/kg) mixed with surfactant, compared with surfactant alone, reduces physiologic BPD or death by 36 weeks' postmenstrual age in extremely preterm infants. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This double-masked randomized clinical trial was conducted from April 2021 to June 2024 in the 17 centers of the United States Neonatal Research Network. Infants 22 to 28 weeks' gestation or 401 to 1000 g birth weight were enrolled after clinical decision to give surfactant, with the first dose of surfactant being study drug (prior surfactant was an exclusion criterion). INTERVENTIONS: Infants were randomly allocated 1:1 to receive 1 to 2 doses of budesonide + surfactant (poractant alfa) or surfactant alone via endotracheal tube within 50 hours of birth. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was physiologic BPD or death by 36 weeks' postmenstrual age. There were 5 prespecified secondary outcomes and multiple prespecified exploratory and safety outcomes. RESULTS: The trial was stopped with 641 infants enrolled (55.3% of 1160 planned; mean birth weight, 810 g [SD, 256 g]; gestational age, 25.9 weeks [SD, 1.9 weeks]), because interim analysis at 50% enrollment reached the prespecified futility threshold. The incidence of BPD or death was 68.5% in the budesonide + surfactant group and 67.9% in the surfactant-alone group (adjusted relative risk [RR], 1.00 [95% CI, 0.90-1.11]). No differences were noted in mortality (15.3% vs 13.2%; adjusted RR, 1.13 [95% CI, 0.78-1.64]) or BPD among survivors to 36 weeks' postmenstrual age (62.9% vs 63.0%; adjusted RR, 0.99 [95% CI, 0.87-1.12]). More infants who received budesonide + surfactant compared with surfactant alone had hyperglycemia (66.7% vs 49.8%; adjusted RR, 1.33 [95% CI, 1.17-1.51]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this large multicenter trial, the combination of budesonide with surfactant did not reduce the risk of BPD or death at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age in extremely preterm infants.

10.1186/s40168-025-02186-8	Microbiome in heritage: how maternal microbiome transmission impacts next	Delaroque C, Chassaing B	After birth, the infant's intestine is colonized by microorganisms, initiating a period of rapid microbial expansion and major compositional maturation influenced by both maternal and environmental factors. Simultaneously, the host's intestinal environment exhibits unique characteristics that facilitate critical interactions with the developing microbiome during this early-life window. These early biological events have lasting effects on health, fostering immune tolerance to environmental exposures or, conversely, increasing susceptibility to noncommunicable diseases-such as allergies, obesity, and inflammatory bowel disease-if microbiome development is disrupted. In this review, we summarize recent advances in understanding the key stages of microbiome development after birth and explore how changes in the maternal environment-especially diet-as well as maternal intestinal bacteria and their derived molecules shape the microbiome's composition and function in early-life, ultimately influencing long-term health and disease risk.

10.3390/nu17182955	Vitamins, Vascular Health and Disease.	Ayoub G	Vascular health relies on the proper function of endothelial cells, which regulate vascular tone, blood fluidity, and barrier integrity. Endothelial dysfunction, often aggravated by inadequate vitamin absorption, contributes to a spectrum of clinical disorders, including cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, peripheral artery disease, age-related macular degeneration, lymphedema, and chronic venous insufficiency. B-group vitamins (especially folate, or vitamin B9), along with vitamins B12, B6, C, D, and E, are essential in maintaining endothelial function, supporting DNA synthesis, regulating methylation, enhancing cellular repair, mitigating oxidative stress and inflammatory signaling, and curtailing vascular damage. Folate is noted for its central function in one-carbon metabolism and in converting homocysteine to methionine, thereby reducing vascular toxicity. We cover natural dietary sources of folate, synthetic folic acid, and the biologically active forms 5-methyl-(6S)-tetrahydrofolate (L-5-MTHF, L-methylfolate) and 5-formyl-(6S)-tetrahydrofolate (levoleucovorin). Therapeutic strategies to address vascular health and prevent hyperhomocysteinemia in order to preclude follow-on disorders include targeted vitamin supplementation, dietary improvements to ensure a sufficient intake of bioavailable nutrient forms, and, in certain clinical contexts, the use of active L-methylfolate or levoleucovorin (a drug product) to bypass metabolic conversion issues. These evidence-based interventions aim to restore endothelial homeostasis, slow disease progression, and improve patient outcomes across a variety of disorders linked to poor vascular health.

The contribution of PNS-resident immune cells to these functions is not fully understood. We identified group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) as a distinct immune cell population resident in the PNS, with a unique gene profile facilitating neuron-ILC2 cross-talk. ILC2-deficient mice display PNS dysfunction (hypersensitivity and gait anomalies). These functional deficits are attributed to structural abnormalities in the sciatic nerves of ILC2-deficient mice. ILC2s communicate with dorsal root ganglion neurons via the interleukin-13 (IL-13) signaling pathway to maintain nerve structure and pain thresholds. Loss of the shared IL-4/IL-13 receptor (IL-4R/IL-13R) in neurons results in a phenotype similar to ILC2-deficient mice. Intrathecally administered IL-13 rescues hypersensitivity and gait defects in ILC2-deficient mice, which suggests that this signaling pathway may be therapeutically important. This work therefore identifies a function for ILC2s in regulating the nerve structural integrity and nociceptive functions of the PNS.	Science immunology	26/09/2025
10.1002/anie.202517917	Cleavable Antibody-Conjugated Aβ Specific Immune Exosome for Combination	Ma M, Wang J, Zhong W, Li Z, Zhao Y	Recent progress in antibody-based immunotherapies for Alzheimer's disease (AD) brings a sense of cautious optimism after years of setbacks. However, these approaches remain constrained by suboptimal pharmacodynamics, modest clinical benefits, and pro-inflammatory adverse effects. Here, we develop a β-secretase-responsive immunotherapeutic agent (ATExo-cL-aA) that synergistically targets amyloid-β (Aβ) and neuroinflammatory response, achieving heightened efficacy while reducing the side effects associated with conventional antibody therapies. After intranasal administration, ATExo-cL-aA actively migrates to AD brains. Upon cleavage by overexpressed β-secretase, ATExo-cL-aA releases aducanumab antibody (aA) and exosomes derived from Aβ antigen-specific Tregs (ATExo), which jointly manage Aβ and inflammatory microglia, thereby synergistically eradicating Aβ and reducing pro-inflammatory responses. In AD mouse models, ATExo-cL-aA demonstrates efficient brain accumulation, robust Aβ removal, microglial normalization, neuroinflammation attenuation, and synaptic preservation, ultimately leading to improved cognitive function. These findings highlight ATExo-cL-aA as next-generation immunotherapeutics that transcend the limitations of conventional antibody-based treatments for AD.

10.1016/j.gie.2025.09.043	A Novel Thin-Needle Knife with High-Pressure Waterjet for Colorectal Underwater	de Sire R, Alfarone L, Capogreco A, Massimi D, Vadalà V, Brandaleone L, Spadaccini M, Alkandari A, Bhandari P, Rosch T, Hassan C, Maselli R, Repici A	BACKGROUND AND AIMS: A novel thin-needle knife with high-pressure waterjet was developed to enhance endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) in terms of ease, speed, and safety. We present first clinical results using this new device. METHODS: We included consecutive colorectal underwater ESD cases over 27 months at two therapeutic endoscopy centers. The new knife (HYBRIDknife® flex I-Type, 1.5 mm) was used at the examiner's discretion and compared to various conventional low-pressure waterjet knives. All cases treated with the new knife were matched 1:1 with controls using propensity score analysis based on lesion size, location, morphology, vascular pattern, and operator experience. RESULTS: Forty matched pairs were analyzed. The mean long axis of ex vivo specimen was 47.2 mm (SD 18.8). Dissection speed was significantly higher with the high-pressure knife (36.7 mm(2)/min vs 28.2; p<0.0001), while R0 resection rates were comparable (97.5% vs 95%; p=0.8). The benefit appeared more pronounced among less experienced operators and with technically challenging lesions. Three intraprocedural perforations occurred in the control group only, while one case of post-endoscopic coagulation syndrome was observed in each group. CONCLUSION: The high-pressure thin-needle knife appears to improve dissection speed with a favorable efficacy and safety profile.	Gastrointestinal endoscopy	25/09/2025

We utilize nucleoside-modified mRNA in lipid nanoparticles (mRNA-LNP) and unmodified self-amplifying mRNA in modified dendritic nanoparticles (sam-MDNP), expressing chimeric hemagglutinin (cHA) antigens to induce stalk-specific humoral immunity in non-human primates with pre-existing influenza virus immunity. mRNA-LNP immunization induces strong stalk-specific binding antibodies capable of protecting mice from lethal heterologous influenza virus challenges and bone marrow plasma cells (BMPCs) that persist for up to 8 months. sam-MDNP vaccine induces lower humoral immunity, despite showing strong innate activation. Transcriptomic and cytokine analyses reveal a more persistent induction of interferon responses, interleukin (IL)-1β signaling, and IL-6 production in the mRNA-LNP group, correlating with the induction of serum antibody responses and BMPCs. These results identify a transcriptional signature associated with induction of BMPCs following mRNA vaccination and highlight the utility of cHA-based mRNA-LNP vaccines in inducing persistent stalk-directed protective antibody responses.

10.3390/medicina61091569	Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPIs)-An Evidence-Based Review of Indications, Efficacy,	Andrawes M, Andrawes W, Das A, Siau K	"Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are among the most prescribed drugs worldwide owing to their proven efficacy in symptom control and mucosal healing for acid-related disorders including gastroesophageal reflux disease (GORD), peptic ulcer disease, Helicobacter pylori eradication, functional dyspepsia, and gastroprotection in high-risk patients. However, long-term use beyond approved indications is increasingly common and has raised safety concerns. Observational studies link chronic PPI use to a myriad of adverse outcomes such as enteric infections (e.g., Clostridioides difficile), nutrient deficiencies (magnesium, vitamin B12), osteoporotic fractures, chronic kidney disease, dementia, and gastric and colorectal cancer. While causality is not always established, these associations warrant cautious risk-benefit assessment in patients receiving prolonged therapy. Current guidelines advocate periodic review of ongoing PPI use and emphasise deprescribing where appropriate. Strategies include dose reduction, on-demand or intermittent use, and switching to H2-receptor antagonists, particularly in patients with non-erosive reflux disease or functional dyspepsia. Tools from the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, American College of Gastroenterology, and the Canadian Deprescribing Network assist clinicians in identifying candidates for tapering or discontinuation. This narrative review focuses on the concept of ""PPI stewardship"" by providing an evidence-based overview of PPI indications, risks, and deprescribing strategies to promote appropriate, safer, and patient-centred use of acid-suppressive therapy."

This systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was conducted to assess the effect of ACV on anthropometric measurements in adults. Methods: We performed a systematic search of PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and CENTRAL up to March 2025 for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in adults (≥18 years) evaluating the effects of ACV for ≥4 weeks on body composition parameters. Primary outcomes included changes in body weight, BMI, waist circumference, and other anthropometric measures. Risk of bias was assessed using the Revised Cochrane Risk-of-bias tool. Results: Out of 2961 reports screened, 10 RCTs comprising a total of 789 participants were eligible for inclusion in this meta-analysis. The pooled results using a random-effects model showed that daily ACV intake significantly reduced body weight [SMD: -0.39; 95% CI: -0.63, -0.15; p = 0.001; I(2) = 62%], BMI [SMD: -0.65; 95% CI: -1.05, -0.26; p = 0.001; I(2) = 83%], and WC [SMD: -0.34; 95% CI: -0.67, -0.02; p = 0.04; I(2) = 61%]. However, no significant effects of ACV were observed on the other body composition parameters analyzed. Sensitivity analyses excluding high-risk-of-bias studies confirmed the robustness of ACV's beneficial effects on body weight and BMI. Subgroup analyses suggested that ACV consumption significantly improved anthropometric parameters when administered for up to 12 weeks, at a dose of 30 mL/day, and in adults who were overweight, obese, or had type 2 diabetes. Conclusions: Overall, this meta-analysis suggests that ACV supplementation may be a promising and accessible adjunctive strategy for short-term weight management in adults with excess body weight or metabolic complications.

10.1186/s13075-025-03647-z	The Glycolysis-HIF-1α axis induces IL-1β of macrophages in rheumatoid arthritis.	Jia Y, Li R, Huang L, Wu X, Zhao L, Yang H, You X, Fei Y	BACKGROUND: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an aggressive, systemic autoimmune disease in which overactivated macrophages play a critical role in its pathogenesis. This study aimed to explore the potential role of glycolytic reprogramming in the production of proinflammatory cytokines by macrophages in RA. METHODS: The Seahorse assay was conducted on RA or healthy control (HC) serum-treated human monocyte-derived macrophages (HMDMs) to evaluate glycolysis levels. RNA sequencing was performed to identify activated signaling pathways and key molecules in HMDMs stimulated by RA serum. The proinflammatory cytokines and hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) were verified by Western blotting and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). RESULTS: We found that HMDMs stimulated with RA serum showed higher aerobic glycolysis levels than those treated with HC serum, along with higher expression of glycolysis-related genes, including hexokinase2 (HK2), pyruvate kinase L/R (PKLR), and phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (PGK1). Furthermore, RA serum-treated macrophages exhibited a higher level of interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), and the expression of IL-1β positively correlated with HK2. Inhibition of glycolysis by 3-bromopyruvate (3BrPA) or HK2 knockdown significantly suppressed IL-1β production in macrophages. The	Arthritis research & therapy	26/09/2025
10.1186/s13024-025-00891-4	The Hippo signaling pathway as a therapeutic target in Alzheimer's disease.	Chen D, Wigglesworth-Littlewood S, Gunn-Moore FJ	The Hippo signaling pathway is well-known for its regulation of organ size, cell proliferation, apoptosis, and cell migration and differentiation. Recent studies have demonstrated that Hippo signaling also plays important roles in the nervous system, being involved in neuroinflammation, neuronal differentiation, and neuronal death and degeneration. As such, dysregulation of Hippo signaling, particularly of its core kinases MST1/2 and LATS1/2, has begun to attract attention in the Alzheimer's disease (AD) field. Here, we discuss the therapeutic potential of targeting the Hippo pathway in AD by providing an overview of Hippo signaling with regards to its function in the nervous system, evidence for its dysregulation in AD patients and models, and recent studies involving genetic or pharmacological modulation of this pathway in AD.

We show that the microbiota governs female reproductive longevity in mice. Germ-free mice have fewer primordial follicles, increased atresia, and ovarian fibrosis, leading to smaller litters, fewer offspring, and a shorter reproductive lifespan. Germ-free mice are born with a similar ovarian reserve but display excessive activation, impaired progression, and increased atresia during post-natal development. Microbiome colonization during a critical post-natal window rescues premature ovarian reserve loss by normalizing follicle kinetics and gene expression patterns. These changes parallel increased short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), and SCFA administration mitigates ovarian dysfunction in germ-free mice. Similar oocyte dysfunction occurred in conventionally raised mice fed a high-fat diet, but additional dietary fiber helped preserve oocyte quality and embryo competence. Thus, host-microbe interactions shape female fertility, and microbiota-targeted interventions may offer strategies to address reproductive disorders.	Cell host & microbe	25/09/2025

Liu F, Niu Y, Zhang Q, Wang K, Dong Z, Wong IN, Cheng L, Li T, Duan L, Li K, Li G, Hou TW, Fok M, Luo H, Chen X, Zhang K, Yin Y	Medical AI agents represent a transformative paradigm in healthcare, distinguished from traditional AI by their autonomy, adaptability, and ability to manage complex tasks. This review introduces a conceptual framework for these agents built on four core components: planning, action, reflection, and memory. We examine the framework's application across key clinical domains, from enhancing diagnostic accuracy and personalizing treatment to guiding robotic surgery and enabling real-time patient monitoring. The review critically analyzes implementation challenges, including technical integration, clinician adoption, regulatory adaptation, and ethical considerations like data privacy and algorithmic bias. Future directions are explored, including the shift toward proactive, multi-agent collaborative systems and the visionary AI Agent Hospital concept. While these agents hold immense potential to revolutionize healthcare delivery by improving efficiency and patient outcomes, their successful and equitable integration hinges on navigating these profound technical, ethical, and regulatory hurdles.

10.1038/s42255-025-01355-1	A non-apoptotic caspase-8-meteorin pathway in hepatocytes promotes MASH fibrosis.	Wang X, Moore MP, Shi H, Xiao Y, Zhang J, Faccioli LAP, Hu Z, Khalid S, Saleheen D, Stupack DG, Kisseleva T, Soto Gutierrez A, Lazar MA, Tabas I	Metabolic-dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) is the leading cause of chronic liver disease, but an incomplete understanding of MASH-induced liver fibrosis has limited therapeutic options. Here we show that hepatocyte caspase-8 drives MASH fibrosis through an apoptosis-independent mechanism. Hepatic caspase-8 expression correlates with liver fibrosis in both human and experimental MASH, and hepatocyte-specific caspase-8 deletion in male mice with MASH suppressed liver fibrosis and hepatic stellate cell (HSC) activation without affecting hepatocyte apoptosis. Mechanistic studies showed that a caspase-8-YY1 pathway in hepatocytes induces secretory meteorin (Metrn), which activates HSCs via a c-Kit-STAT3 pathway. Meteorin expression was increased in human and male mouse MASH livers and decreased by deletion of hepatocyte caspase-8 in MASH mice and human and mouse primary hepatocytes. Genetic restoration of hepatocyte meteorin in hepatocyte-caspase-8-deleted MASH mice restored HSC activation and liver fibrosis while silencing hepatocyte meteorin lowered liver fibrosis. These findings reveal a therapeutically targetable pathway promoting MASH fibrosis involving a non-apoptotic function of caspase-8 and a newly discovered HSC activator, meteorin.

Despite its unique anatomical connection to the brain, the role of the nasal microbiome in neurological diseases is understudied. Here, using human data and experiments in mice, we show that nasal Staphylococcus aureus is linked to depression. Nasal microbiome analyses revealed a positive correlation between depression scores and S. aureus abundance among patients with depression and healthy controls. Metabolomics of the nasal cavity showed decreased sex hormones, estradiol and testosterone in patients with depression versus controls. Nasal microbiota transplants from patients reproduced depression-like behaviour in mice with differential abundance of S. aureus. Further homology and mutational analysis uncovered an S. aureus sex hormone-degrading enzyme, 17b-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (Hsd12), which degraded testosterone and estradiol in mice, leading to lower levels of dopamine and serotonin in the murine brain. These findings reveal a nasal commensal that influences depressive behaviour and provides insights into the nose-brain axis.	Nature microbiology	22/09/2025

These ADCs have shown substantial efficacy, improving survival in patients who have progressed after chemotherapy and immunotherapy. Imaging plays a pivotal role in ADC-based therapy, extending beyond diagnosis and staging to assessing treatment response, detecting recurrence, and evaluating toxicity. Computed tomography (CT), multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) are widely used for these purposes. Despite the efficacy of ADCs, resistance mechanisms such as antigen loss and payload resistance continue to pose challenges, necessitating the development of next-generation ADCs. Response assessment largely relies on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1, with growing interest in multiparametric MRI for evaluating complete response in bladder lesions. Additionally, imaging helps identify ADC-related toxicities, including pneumonitis and gastrointestinal complications. Radiologists must be aware of these evolving therapeutic and imaging paradigms to optimize patient management. The integration of imaging with ADC-based treatment requires a multidisciplinary approach to improve outcomes. This review highlights the critical role of imaging in ADC therapy and underscores the need for radiologists to adapt to these advancements in bladder cancer treatment.

PM(2.5) was modeled using satellite, remote sensing, meteorological and land use data. We applied conditional logistic regression to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and confidence intervals (CIs) per 10-µg/m(3) increase in PM(2.5.) We assessed effect modification to determine the most susceptible subgroups. Infant bronchiolitis risk was elevated for PM(2.5) exposure 1 day (OR = 1.07, 95% CI = 1.03-1.11) and 4 days (OR = 1.04, 95% CI = 0.99-1.08) prior to clinical encounter, but not 7 days. Non-significant associations with otitis media varied depending on lag. Preterm infants were at substantially increased risk of bronchiolitis 1 day prior to clinical encounter (OR = 1.17, 95% CI = 1.08-1.28) and otitis media 4 and 7 days prior to clinical encounter (OR = 1.09, 95% CI = 1.02-1.16 and OR = 1.08, 95% CI = 1.02-1.15, respectively). In conclusion, preterm infants are most susceptible to infant bronchiolitis and otitis media associated with acute PM(2.5) exposures.

10.1177/21501319251379740	Healthcare Utilization Unchanged in the Control Arm of a Randomized Clinical	Gongloor P, Nadeem S, Yu X, Raji M, Mena KD, Vaughan EM	BACKGROUND: In low-income settings, clinical trial participation may influence participant behavior, including among control groups. Increased access to care and heightened health awareness during trial enrollment could lead to altered behaviors, a phenomenon known as the Hawthorne effect, which may obscure true intervention impacts; however, this effect remains poorly studied in low-income environments. AIM: To conduct a secondary exploratory analysis of healthcare utilization among control participants of a randomized clinical trial (RCT). METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed electronic medical records from the control arm (n = 26) of an RCT involving low-income Hispanic adults with type 2 diabetes receiving care at a community clinic. Before randomization to a 12-month diabetes education intervention or usual care (control), participants underwent on-site measurements of HbA1c, blood pressure, and weight. Healthcare utilization among control participants was compared during the year before and throughout the study, including all types of exposures: provider visits and other services (eg, orders). RESULTS: Total healthcare utilization was similar between the pre-period (11.9 exposures/year) and the study-period (11.4 exposures/year; P = .93), with no significant changes across visit types. There were no significant differences in fitted mean monthly visits between the pre- and study-periods (P = .93), nor over time (P = .89). CONCLUSIONS: This exploratory study found no evidence of a Hawthorne effect on healthcare utilization among control participants. While this may suggest consistent healthcare behaviors, it may also highlight an important public health concern: individuals in low-income settings may lack the resources to translate increased awareness into health-related action. Larger studies are needed to further elucidate behavioral patterns in low-income populations.	Journal of primary care & community health	01/12/2025
10.1186/s40001-025-03108-y	Identification of hub gene and immune infiltration in Lyme disease revealed by	Dong Y, Liu M, Luo Y, Chen Y, Chen X, Liu X, Cai X, Yang F, Song C, Zhou G	"INTRODUCTION: Lyme disease (LD), caused by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi (Bb), is a multisystem disorder with early symptoms such as erythema migrans and late manifestations including arthritis and neuroborreliosis. The molecular mechanisms driving tissue damage and inflammatory dysregulation in LD remain incompletely characterized. Given the central role of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in orchestrating immune responses, we aimed to identify optimal feature genes (OFGs) within PBMCs associated with LD pathogenesis and delineate their immune infiltration patterns using integrated bioinformatics. METHODS: Transcriptomic datasets (GSE42606, GSE68765, GSE103481) were retrieved from GEO. Differential expression analysis identified LD-related genes. Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) screened disease-associated modules. Feature selection was performed via SVM-Recursive Feature Elimination (SVM-RFE), Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression, and random forest (RF) to pinpoint OFGs. Immune cell infiltration was quantified using CIBERSORT, followed by correlation analysis between OFGs and immune subsets. The Single-gene gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was performed to explore the functional associations of OFGs. Biological pathways linked to OFGs were inferred by single-sample GSEA (ssGSEA). Diagnostic utility was assessed via ROC curves and nomogram modeling. Finally, we used RT-qPCR to confirm the bioinformatics results. RESULTS: Our study identified 174 DEGs among the LD patients, with 156 genes located within the ""turquoise"" module by WGCNA, exhibiting the most robust correlation with clinical characteristics. Among these, KIAA1199 turned out to be the unique OFG, selected via three distinct machine learning methodologies, possessing exceptional diagnostic potential. The Single-gene gene set enrichment analysis showed KIAA1199 was strongly correlated with multiple immune-related pathways. Furthermore, RT-qPCR validated candidate gene expression within a THP-1 cellular model. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, this study integrated WGCNA and machine learning methodologies to identify one core gene associated with LD from PBMC gene expression data: KIAA1199. The predictive model constructed using these genes demonstrated robust diagnostic accuracy, providing a basis for further research on host immune responses and the development of new diagnostic methods."

10.1021/acs.biochem.5c00468	Molecular Mechanisms Underlying the Construction of Ciliary Doublet Microtubules.	Chen Z, Ou G	Motile cilia and flagella are complex microtubule-based organelles essential for cell motility, fluid flow, and sensory functions. At the core of these organelles lie doublet microtubules (DMTs), specialized structures consisting of an A-tubule and a B-tubule that serve as the scaffold for axonemal complexes. Recent advances have uncovered the intricate architecture of DMTs, highlighting inner and outer junction proteins, luminal scaffolds, and interdoublet linkers critical for structural stability and function. Studies in model organisms such as Chlamydomonas, Tetrahymena, and Caenorhabditis elegans have identified conserved regulators orchestrating DMT assembly. Parallel insights from human genetics reveal that mutations in DMT-associated proteins underlie a subset of cases of primary ciliary dyskinesia and other ciliopathies. This review synthesizes current understanding of DMT biogenesis from molecular, structural, and disease perspectives, illuminating how coordinated assembly ensures ciliary function and how its disruption leads to human disease.

10.1186/s12951-025-03676-5	Neutrophil membrane-encapsulated nanosonosensitizer with ultrasound-reinforced	Du C, Wang S, Cheng Y, Li J, Zhang Y, Li Z, Zhu B, Wu Z, Zhang X, Zhou L	Pneumonia caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) infection remains a formidable clinical challenge due to persistent biofilm formation and intrinsic antibiotic resistance, exacerbated by bacterial iron homeostasis that stabilizes biofilm architecture and neutralizes oxidative stress. Herein, we present Fe/TNT@NM, a biomimetic nanosonosensitizer activated by ultrasound (US) to dismantle biofilms through dual extracellular-intracellular mechanisms. The nanosonosensitizer features an iron-doped titanate nanotube (Fe/TNT) core encapsulated within a neutrophil membrane (NM). Under US irradiation, Fe/TNT@NM generates sonodynamic reactive oxygen species (ROS) extracellularly and enhances Fe(3+) release. These ions catalyze the Fenton reaction extracellularly to amplify chemodynamic effects and disrupt intracellular iron homeostasis, triggering bacterial ferroptosis. The NM coating enables immune evasion and biofilm-targeted delivery. This ultrasound-reinforced ferroptosis strategy synchronizes extracellular ROS storms with intracellular iron dyshomeostasis, achieving dual-action biofilm dismantling and eradication of drug-resistant P. aeruginosa. In a murine pneumonia model, Fe/TNT@NM suppresses biofilms and mitigates pulmonary injury. By converging biomimetic targeting, sonodynamic-chemodynamic cascades, and ultrasound-augmented ferroptosis, this nanosonosensitizer presents a paradigm-shifting approach to combat refractory biofilm infections and antibiotic resistance.

10.1016/j.ejmech.2025.118197	Bufalin targeting METTL17 inhibits the occurrence and metastasis of oral cancer	Zhang H, Sun F, Ding X, Dong X, Yang F, Chen R, Zhang X, Wen Z, Su M, Yu C, Wang Y, Yang L, Li B	Oral cancer (OC) is a malignant tumor that arises at the mucosal tissues of the oral cavity and is commonly treated with surgical resection. Bufalin is one of the most potent anticancer monomers extracted from bufonis venenum and has been shown to have anticancer effects against a wide range of cancers, including lung cancer, gastric cancer and hepatocellular carcinomas. However, there are fewer studies on the role of bufalin in OC and a lack of clear targets. Moreover, bufalin is more difficult to apply clinically due to its cardiac glycoside effects. Notably, oral cancer is a facial tumor, and bufalin acts first in the oral tissues and does not need to go through the blood circulation to reach the heart, which greatly mitigates the risk and overcomes the major limitation. The effects of bufalin on the proliferation and migration of oral cancer cells were detected by CCK-8 assay, wound healing assay, transwell assay and Western blot. Potential direct interacting proteins of bufalin were screened by human proteomic microarray, and the binding sites were predicted using molecular docking technology. In vitro and vivo biological experiments were performed to verify the role of bufalin direct interacting protein and the mechanism by which bufalin targets this protein to inhibit OC metastasis. The results showed that bufalin inhibited the proliferation and migration of OC cell lines from Cal-27, HN30 and	European journal of medicinal chemistry	23/09/2025
10.3390/molecules30183823	Vitamin D Associated with Exercise Can Be Used as a Promising Tool in	Farina G, Crescioli C	Neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, and Huntington's disease, represent unmet medical and social needs. Still, no definitive cure exists for these illnesses, hence a therapeutic approach with molecules able to prevent/downtone/modify the disease seems highly attractive. Remarkably, a higher risk of neurodegenerative disease is associated with low vitamin D levels. Vitamin D is a multifaceted molecule able to target critical neuroinflammatory processes underlying neurodegeneration, acting through genomic or rapid signaling. This narrative review aims to focus on vitamin D's potential to be an optimal neuroprotective molecule, based on its ability to target and counteract aberrant biomolecular processes involved in neuroinflammation/neurodegeneration. Noticeably, exercise can potentiate vitamin D's protective effect through some anti-inflammatory actions exerted on shared biomolecular targets. Thus, although vitamin D is not strictly a drug, it could be potentially allocated within the therapeutic approach to neurodegenerative diseases in combination with adapted exercise, best as an early intervention. Topics on the complexity concerning the doses for supplementation and data discrepancy from trials are addressed. The urgent demand is to test and clarify vitamin D efficacy and safety, combined or not with exercise, in clinical settings.	Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)	21/09/2025
10.3390/molecules30183814	The Efficacy of Melatonergic Receptor Agonists Used in Clinical Practice in	Żełabowski K, Pichowicz W, Skowron I, Szwach J, Biedka K, Wesołowski M, Błaszczyk K, Ziobro O, Petrov W, Kukula-Koch W, Chłopaś-Konowałek A	Insomnia is a common and complex disorder, rooted in the dysregulation of circadian rhythms, impaired neurotransmitter function, and disturbances in sleep-wake homeostasis. While conventional hypnotics such as benzodiazepines and Z-drugs are effective in the short term, their use is limited by a high potential for dependence, cognitive side effects, and withdrawal symptoms. In contrast, melatonergic receptor agonists-melatonin, ramelteon, tasimelteon, and agomelatine-represent a pharmacologically targeted alternative that modulates MT1 and MT2 receptors, which are pivotal to the regulation of circadian timing and sleep initiation. Clinical evidence supports the efficacy of these agents in reducing sleep onset latency, extending total sleep duration, and re-aligning disrupted circadian rhythms, particularly among older individuals and patients with non-24 h sleep-wake disorders. Notably, agomelatine offers additional antidepressant properties through selective antagonism of the 5-HT(2C) receptor in micromolar concentrations. In contrast, its agonistic activity at melatonergic receptors is observed in the low sub-nanomolar range, which illustrates the complexity of this drug's interactions with the human body. All compounds reviewed demonstrate a generally favorable safety and tolerability profile. Accumulating evidence highlights that selected medicinal plants, such as chamomilla, lemon balm, black cumin, valeriana, passionflower and lavender, may exert relevant hypnotic or anxiolytic effects, thus complementing melatonergic strategies in the management of insomnia. This structured narrative review presents a comprehensive analysis of the molecular pharmacology, receptor affinity, signaling pathways, and clinical outcomes associated with melatonergic agents. It also examines their functional interplay with serotonergic, GABAergic, dopaminergic, and orexinergic systems involved in arousal and sleep regulation.

Here, we perform an in vivo CRISPR screen in an HNSCC mouse model to identify immune evasion genes. We identify several regulators of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) response, including the ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase 5 (UCHL5). Loss of Uchl5 in tumors increases CD8(+) T cell infiltration and improved ICB responses. Uchl5 deficiency attenuates extracellular matrix (ECM) production and epithelial-mesenchymal-transition (EMT) transcriptional programs, which contribute to stromal desmoplasia, a histologic finding we describe as associated with reduced anti-PD1 response in human HNSCCs. COL17A1, a collagen highly and specifically expressed in HNSCC, mediates in part Uchl5-mediated immune evasion. Our findings suggest an unappreciated role for UCHL5 in promoting EMT in HNSCC and highlight ECM modulation as a strategy to improve immunotherapy responses.	Nature communications	29/09/2025
10.2147/JIR.S514838	Microbiome-Gut-Brain Axis: Implications for the Links Between Inflammatory Bowel	Tian CM, Yang MF, Kong C, Luo D, Yue NN, Zhao HL, Zhang Y, Lu JP, Liang YJ, Song Y, Wei DR, Yao J, Wang LS, Li DF	The brain and gastrointestinal tract are closely interconnected as important sensory organs processing signals from both environmental and internal cues. Recent studies have shown that dysregulation of the gut microbiota in inflammatory bowel disease activates the gut immune system. The cross-talk mechanism along the gut-brain axis is implicated in the development of neuropsychiatric disorders such as autism, depression, anxiety, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease. Here, we discuss the molecular mechanisms involved in signaling across the gut-brain axis, including the immune and neuroendocrine system, intestinal permeability, microbial composition, and bacterial extracellular vesicles. We focus on the link between specific inflammatory bowel disease, microbial genera and psychiatric and neurological disorders, and propose that the results of preclinical and clinical studies open up the possibility of targeting the gut microbiota to treat neuropsychiatric disorders that are altered by gut interactions.

Farhan H, Raote I, Campelo F, Ge L, Hirschberg K, Forrester A, Zanetti G, Lippincott-Schwartz J, Pastor-Pareja JC, Perez F, Saito K, Malhotra V	Endoplasmic reticulum exit sites (ERES) are specialized, ribosome-free ER subdomains that serve as dynamic portals for COPII-mediated export of proteins from the ER. Beyond their role in the secretory pathway, ERES are implicated in diverse processes, including autophagy and the maturation of lipid droplets, highlighting their functional plasticity. ERES integrate cargo load, membrane tension and spatial cues to remodel their architecture and function in real time. This Roadmap synthesizes our current knowledge on the biogenesis, structural diversity and regulatory logic of ERES. We highlight key unanswered questions in the field, particularly concerning how ERES integrate signals to coordinate protein trafficking under varying cellular states. Finally, we propose a multidisciplinary framework - leveraging advances in high-resolution imaging, synthetic reconstitution and computational modelling - to delineate the principles governing the function and plasticity of ERES. Understanding these mechanisms holds significant potential for developing targeted therapeutic strategies in diseases linked to trafficking dysfunction.	Nature reviews.

They are heterogeneous cells compartmentalized along the crypt-villus axis, but the mechanisms governing the maintenance of this telocyte population remain unclear. Here, we identify a distinct population of subepithelial mesenchymal cells in the developing mouse embryo, marked by LIM Domain Only 3 (Lmo3), as the cellular origin of post-natal intestinal telocytes. The Lmo3(+) cells emerge prior to villus formation at embryonic day 13.5, and after birth, they progressively acquire a spatial confinement to the intestinal isthmus region, where they persist as long-lived, slow-cycling cells, supplying both peri-villus and peri-crypt telocytes. Further, we show that Lmo3(+) cells respond rapidly to tissue damage, becoming activated to promote repair of the telocyte niche. Therefore, a quiescent and damage-responsive progenitor cell population marked by Lmo3 maintains the intestinal telocyte niche.	Developmental cell	26/09/2025

Ninjurin-1 (NINJ1) is a recently identified mediator of plasma membrane rupture but functions diversely in different types of cell death. However, little is known about the role of NINJ1 in IAV-induced PANoptosis and viral pneumonia. Here, we report that IAV infection triggered an increase in the expression of NINJ1, which then oligomerized and mediated cell lysis in infected macrophages. The deficiency of NINJ1 prevented plasma membrane rupture and the release of DAMPs and IL-1β without affecting the progression of cell death. Activation of any single PANoptosis pathway was sufficient to trigger the oligomerization of NINJ1 and robust cell lysis. Accordingly, only when all PANoptosis pathways were concurrently blocked could the oligomerization of NINJ1, cell death, and cell rupture be prevented. Ablation of NINJ1 in vivo also alleviated IAV-induced lung injury and mortality. Furthermore, we revealed an association between NINJ1 upregulation and poor outcomes in patients with COVID-19. Collectively, our findings indicate a pivotal role of NINJ1 in the immunopathology of IAV infection and its potential as a bioindicator of disease severity and prognosis in viral pneumonia and viral sepsis.

10.1016/j.cell.2025.09.004	Functional RNA splitting drove the evolutionary emergence of type V CRISPR-Cas	Jin S, Zhu Z, Li Y, Zhang S, Liu Y, Li D, Li Y, Luo Y, Cheng Z, Zhao KT, Gao Q, Yang G, Li H, Liang R, Zhang R, Qiu JL, Zhang YE, Liu JG, Gao C	Transposon-encoded TnpB nucleases gave rise to type V CRISPR-Cas12 effectors through multiple independent domestication events. These systems use different RNA molecules as guides for DNA targeting: transposon-derived right-end RNAs (reRNAs or omega RNAs) for TnpB and CRISPR RNAs for type V CRISPR-Cas systems. However, the molecular mechanisms bridging transposon activity and CRISPR immunity remain unclear. We identify TranCs (transposon-CRISPR intermediates) derived from distinct IS605- or IS607-TnpB lineages. TranCs utilize both CRISPR RNAs and reRNAs to direct DNA cleavage. The cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of LaTranC from Lawsonibacter sp. closely resembles that of the ISDra2 TnpB complex; however, unlike a single-molecule reRNA, the LaTranC guide RNA is functionally split into a tracrRNA and crRNA. An engineered RNA split of ISDra2 TnpB enabled activity with a CRISPR array. These findings indicate that functional RNA splitting was the primary molecular event driving the emergence of diverse type V CRISPR-Cas systems from transposons.	Cell	29/09/2025

Herein, we show that the serum contents of elastin-, hyaluronic acid- and fibronectin-derived fragments are all positively correlated with age. Elastin-derived fragments exhibited the most potent lifespan-shortening effects in mice and a positive correlation with various aging indicators in a human cohort (n = 1,068). Mechanistically, the VGVAPG oligopeptide (E-motif) in elastin-derived fragments activated monocytes and macrophages through NEU1, a component of the elastin receptor complex, which consequently caused an inflammatory response. Therapeutically, a NEU1 inhibitor extended lifespan by up to 17% in wild-type naturally aged mice and alleviated aging-related phenotypes in wild-type mice, immune-humanized mice and pigs. This study uncovers that degraded ECM acts as a circulating driver of aging, providing an anti-aging intervention strategy focused on particular elastin fragment signals.	Nature aging	29/09/2025
10.3389/fnut.2025.1657587	Trajectories of health conditions predict cardiovascular disease risk among	Li W, Liu T, Hu Y, Zhou H, Liu Y, Zeng H, Zhang Y, Zhang C, Li K, Hu Z, Chen P, Wang H, Xie B, Zhong X	BACKGROUND: Most previous studies have focused on the association between health conditions measured at a single time point and the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), while evidence regarding the impact of long-term trajectories of health conditions is limited. This study aimed to construct models of health condition trajectories and to evaluate their association with CVD risk and predictive value. METHODS: This study included 2,512 participants aged 45 years and older from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS), who were followed from 2011 to 2018. Trajectories of multimorbidity status, activities of daily living (ADLs) limitations, body roundness index (BRI), pain, sleep duration, depressive symptoms, and cognitive function were identified using latent class growth models (LCGMs). Cox regression models were used to assess associations between these trajectories and incident CVD. Ten machine learning (ML) algorithms were applied to evaluate the predictive capacity of different variable groups for CVD. Additionally, SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values were used to interpret predictor importance and direction in the machine learning models. RESULTS: Distinct high-risk trajectories of physical and psychological health were independently associated with increased CVD risk. Higher risks of CVD were observed for the moderate-ascending (HR = 1.42, 95% CI: 1.08-1.89) and high-ascending (3.01, 2.16-4.20) trajectories of multimorbidity status; the high-ascending trajectory of ADLs limitations (2.58, 1.87-3.56); the high-stable trajectory of BRI (1.67, 1.03-2.70); the moderate-ascending (1.51, 1.07-2.12) and high-ascending (2.28, 1.56-3.35) trajectories of pain; the moderate-descending (1.51, 1.09-2.10), low-ascending (1.70, 1.22-2.38), and high-posterior-ascending (2.54, 1.69-3.82) trajectories of depressive symptoms; and the low-ascending trajectory of sleep duration (1.33, 1.02-1.74). Notably, the model based on trajectories of health conditions achieved the highest predictive performance among all variable groups (CatBoost AUC = 0.740), with SHAP analysis confirming that the trajectories of multimorbidity status, BRI, and ADLs limitations were the most influential predictors. CONCLUSION: Long-term deterioration in both physical and psychological health is strongly associated with increased CVD risk, highlighting the importance of early intervention and continuous health monitoring.

10.1016/j.phymed.2025.157307	Dihydroartemisinin inhibits histone lactylation through YAP1 to act as a 'hot'	Gao Y, Gong Y, Song X, Xiong Y, Lu J, Yang Y, Gong Y, Du Z, Wang S, Jia R, Gong P, Shi X	BACKGROUND: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is characterized by a 'cold' tumor microenvironment (TME), which limits the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). In a previous study, we demonstrated that dihydroartemisinin (DHA) could disrupt the immunosuppressive TME and delay HCC progression. PURPOSE: This study aimed to explore the precise mechanisms underlying the shift of the TME from an immunosuppressive to an immunostimulatory state. METHODS: We constructed HCC subcutaneous allograft mice model to investigate the in vivo antitumor effects of DHA. We further performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and multiplex immunohistochemistry (mIHC) to analyze the immune dynamics during DHA-induced TME transition in HCC. Using NCG mice (lacking T, B, and NK cells), BALB/c nude mice (lacking T cells), and CD8(+) T cell-depleted mice, we assessed whether the antitumor effect of DHA in HCC depends on its immune functions and determined the key role of T cells in antitumor immunity. Additional downstream mechanisms were explored using YAP1 knockdown HCC cells and liver-specific Yap1 knockout mice through techniques such as Western blot, immunofluorescence (IF), metabolic flux analysis, co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP), chemokine chip, and flow cytometry (FCM). RESULTS: We observed that DHA transforms the TME of HCC from an immune-cold to an immune-hot state by increasing the abundance and proportion of T cells, NK cells, M1-like TAMs, and DCs. Notably, DHA was found to enhance the proportion of IFN-γ(+) CD8(+) T cells within the TME of HCC-bearing mice, and its therapeutic effects were dependent on CD8(+) T cells. Our results suggest that DHA could suppress histone lactylation (Kla) and acetylation (Kac) in HCC cells by inhibiting YAP1. Mechanistically, DHA reduces lactate transport, thereby decreasing lactate accumulation within the TME, lowering P300/CBP catalytic activity, and enhancing the deacetylation effect of HDAC1-3. This finding reveals a new mechanism by which DHA, through metabolic changes and epigenetic regulation, remodels the TME of HCC. Additionally, a combination strategy involving DHA and anti-PD-1 therapy demonstrated the potential to reshape the cold HCC TME via inhibition of the YAP1-lactylation positive feedback loop. CONCLUSION: Our study confirms that DHA inhibits histone Kla in HCC cells through YAP1 inhibition, which shifts the TME from an immune-cold to immune-hot state. Moreover, DHA enhance the anti-HCC immune response dependent on CD8(+) T cells, thereby sensitizing anti-PD-1 therapy. This novel finding positions DHA as a promising strategy for optimizing anti-PD-1 therapy in HCC, warranting further clinical application studies.

10.1002/alz.70726	Alzheimer's disease diagnostic progression is associated with cerebrovascular	Edwards NC, Lao PJ, Alshikho MJ, Ericsson OM, Rizvi B, Petersen ME, O'Bryant S, Flores-Aguilar L, Simoes S, Mapstone M, Tudorascu DL, Janelidze S, Hansson O, Handen BL, Christian BT, Lee JH, Lai F, Rosas HD, Zaman S, Lott IT, Yassa MA, Gutierrez J, Wilcock DM, Head E, Brickman AM	INTRODUCTION: Despite having few vascular risk factors, people with Down syndrome (DS) have MRI evidence of cerebrovascular disease (CVD) and neuroinflammation that worsens with Alzheimer's disease (AD) severity. We investigated whether markers of CVD and inflammation are associated with AD-related diagnostic progression in people with DS. METHODS: We included 149 participants (mean age [SD] = 44.6 [9]) from the Alzheimer's Biomarkers Consortium-Down Syndrome who had two (n = 24) or three follow-up visits (n = 125). We derived white matter hyperintensity (WMH) volume and plasma biomarker (glial fibrillary acidic protein [GFAP], amyloid beta [Aβ]42/Aβ40, hyperphosphorylated tau-217 [p-tau217], and neurofilament light [NfL]) concentrations at baseline and examined their association with progression in clinical diagnosis. RESULTS: Higher baseline WMH volume and higher GFAP were associated with a greater likelihood of diagnostic progression. Combining WMH and GFAP with p-tau217 improved clinical conversion classification accuracy over AD biomarkers alone. Among individuals with evidence of amyloidosis, both WMH and GFAP were associated with clinical progression. DISCUSSION: In DS, markers of CVD and inflammation are independently and synergistically associated with clinical AD progression. HIGHLIGHTS: Higher baseline white matter hyperintensity (WMH) volume and plasma glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) concentration were associated with a higher likelihood of progressing from cognitively stable to either mild cognitive impairment or clinical Alzheimer's disease in Down syndrome. WMH volume and GFAP concentration discriminated between those who progressed and those who did not. Models including the independent and interactive effects of WMH and GFAP more accurately discriminated between participants who progressed diagnostically from those who did not. Individuals with evidence of amyloid pathology were more likely to progress if they also had elevated WMH or GFAP.	Alzheimer's & dementia : the journal of the Alzheimer's Association	01/10/2025
10.1089/rej.2012.1389	Protective effects of ginger root extract on Alzheimer disease-induced behavioral	Zeng GF, Zhang ZY, Lu L, Xiao DQ, Zong SH, He JM	The aim of this study was to assess the ability of a traditional Chinese medicinal ginger root extract (GRE) to prevent behavioral dysfunction in the Alzheimer disease (AD) rat model. Rat AD models were established by an operation (OP) in which rats were treated with a one-time intra-cerebroventricuIar injection of amyloid β-protein (Aβ) and continuous gavage of aluminum chloride every day for 4 weeks. GRE was administered intra-gastrically to rats. After 35 days, learning and memory were assessed in all of the rats. Brain sections were processed for immunohistochemistry and Hematoxylin & Eosin (H&E) and Nissl staining. The latency to show significant memory deficits was shorter in the group that received OP with a high dose of GRE (HG)(OP+HG) than in the groups that received OP with a low or moderate dose of GRE (LG, MG)(OP+LG, OP+MG) (p<0.05). The expression of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) in the OP+MG and OP+LG groups was up-regulated compared to the OP+HG groups (p<0.05). The rats in the OP+HG groups had lower levels of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), and malondialdehyde (MDA) expression than the rats in the OP+MG and OP+LG groups (p<0.05). This experiment demonstrates that the administration of GRE reverses behavioral dysfunction and prevents AD-like symptoms in our rat model.	Rejuvenation research	01/04/2013

Imbalanced nucleotide synthesis triggers the release of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) to the cytosol and an innate immune response through cGAS-STING signalling(3). However, how nucleotide deficiency drives mtDNA-dependent inflammation has not been elucidated. Here we show that nucleotide imbalance leads to an increased misincorporation of ribonucleotides into mtDNA during age-dependent renal inflammation in a mouse model lacking the mitochondrial exonuclease MGME1(4), in various tissues of aged mice and in cells lacking the mitochondrial i-AAA protease YME1L. Similarly, reduced deoxyribonucleotide synthesis increases the ribonucleotide content of mtDNA in cell-cycle-arrested senescent cells. This leads to mtDNA release into the cytosol, cGAS-STING activation and the mtDNA-dependent senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), which can be suppressed by exogenously added deoxyribonucleosides. Our results highlight the sensitivity of mtDNA to aberrant ribonucleotide incorporation and show that imbalanced nucleotide metabolism leads to age- and mtDNA-dependent inflammatory responses and SASP in senescence.

10.1016/j.clinph.2020.11.036	Influence of unfused cranial bones on magnetoencephalography signals in human	Lew S, Hämäläinen MS, Ahlfors SP, Okada Y	OBJECTIVE: To clarify the effects of unfused cranial bones on magnetoencephalography (MEG) signals during early development. METHODS: In a simulation study, we compared the MEG signals over a spherical head model with a circular hole mimicking the anterior fontanel to those over the same head model without the fontanel for different head and fontanel sizes with varying skull thickness and conductivity. RESULTS: The fontanel had small effects according to three indices. The sum of differences in signal over a sensor array due to a fontanel, for example, was < 6% of the sum without the fontanel. However, the fontanel effects were extensive for dipole sources deep in the brain or outside the fontanel for larger fontanels. The effects were comparable in magnitude for tangential and radial sources. Skull thickness significantly increased the effect, while skull conductivity had minor effects. CONCLUSION: MEG signal is weakly affected by a fontanel. However, the effects can be extensive and significant for radial sources, thicker skull and large fontanels. The fontanel effects can be intuitively explained by the concept of secondary sources at the fontanel wall. SIGNIFICANCE: The minor influence of unfused cranial bones simplifies MEG analysis, but it should be considered for quantitative analysis.

10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.112.190991	Influence of high glycemic index and glycemic load diets on blood pressure during	Gopinath B, Flood VM, Rochtchina E, Baur LA, Smith W, Mitchell P	We aimed to prospectively examine the association between the glycemic index and glycemic load of foods consumed and the dietary intakes of carbohydrates, sugars, fiber, and principal carbohydrate-containing food groups (eg, breads, cereals, and sugary drinks) with changes in blood pressure during adolescence. A total of 858 students aged 12 years at baseline (422 girls and 436 boys) were examined from 2004-2005 to 2009-2011. Dietary data were assessed from validated semiquantitative food frequency questionnaires. Blood pressure was measured using a standard protocol. In girls, after adjusting for age, ethnicity, parental education, parental history of hypertension, baseline height, baseline blood pressure, change in body mass index, and time spent in physical and sedentary activities, each 1-SD (1-SD = 7.10 g/d) increase in baseline dietary intake of total fiber was associated with a 0.96-, 0.62-, and 0.75-mmHg decrease in mean systolic (P = 0.02), diastolic (P = 0.01), and arterial blood pressures (P = 0.002), respectively, 5 years later. In girls, each 1-SD increase in dietary glycemic index, glycemic load, carbohydrate, and fructose was concurrently related to increases of 1.81 (P = 0.001), 4.02 (P = 0.01), 4.74 (P = 0.01), and 1.80 mm Hg (P = 0.03) in systolic blood pressure, respectively, >5 years. Significant associations between carbohydrate nutrition variables and blood pressure were not observed among boys. Excessive dietary intake of carbohydrates, specifically from high glycemic index/glycemic load foods, could adversely influence blood pressure, particularly in girls, whereas fiber-rich diets may be protective against elevated blood pressure during adolescence.

This study investigated the safety and exploratory pharmacodynamics of bexotegrast (PLN-74809), an oral, once-daily inhibitor of α(v)β(6) and α(v)β(1) integrins, in participants with PSC and liver fibrosis. METHODS: In this Phase 2, double-blind, dose-ranging study, 117 participants with PSC were randomized 3:1 to receive once-daily oral bexotegrast or placebo in 3 cohorts (40 mg or placebo for 12 weeks [part 1]; 80 mg, 160 mg, or placebo for 12 weeks [part 2]; and 320 mg or placebo for ≤40 weeks [part 3]). The primary endpoint was the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs). Exploratory pharmacodynamic endpoints included changes in alkaline phosphatase values, enhanced liver fibrosis (ELF) scores, neoepitope-specific N-terminal pro-peptide of type III collagen levels, liver stiffness measurements, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures using gadoxetate, and the Itch Numeric Rating Scale. RESULTS: A total of 117 participants received bexotegrast (40 mg [n=22], 80 mg [n=21], 160 mg [n=21], 320 mg [n=27]) or placebo (n=30). Bexotegrast was well tolerated, with similar rates of TEAEs in the pooled bexotegrast and placebo groups (72.7% and 70.0%). TEAEs were mild to moderate, and no serious TEAEs related to study drug were observed. Numerically less pharmacodynamic progression was observed with bexotegrast in ELF score, PRO-C3, and MRI assessments at Week 12 compared with placebo. Pharmacodynamic results at Week 24 showed limited change from Week 12 except in MRI parameters which continued to improve. CONCLUSIONS: Bexotegrast was well tolerated in participants with PSC and liver fibrosis for up to 40 weeks with numerically less progression observed in exploratory pharmacodynamic markers. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT04480840 PRIMARY SOURCE OF FUNDING: Pliant Therapeutics, Inc. IMPACT AND IMPLICATIONS: Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a rare cholestatic disease of unknown etiology. Currently, there is an unmet medical need for safe and effective therapies capable of halting or reversing progression of PSC. In this Phase 2 study in participants with PSC and suspected liver fibrosis, bexotegrast, an oral, once-daily, dual selective inhibitor of α(v)β(6) and α(v)β(1) integrins, had a favorable safety and tolerability profile. This study supports targeting integrin-mediated transforming growth factor-β activation as a potential therapeutic approach for PSC.	Journal of hepatology	26/09/2025

However, the US Food and Drug Administration has warned about potential risks of Fournier gangrene, a severe genital infection associated with SGLT2I use. OBJECTIVE: To determine comparative risks of male external genital infections (MEGIs) in adult male patients with T2D treated with SGLT2Is. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A population-based cohort study analyzing Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database was conducted to evaluate the MEGI risk in adult male patients with T2D newly treated with SGLT2Is between January 1, 2009, and December 31, 2020. Patients newly treated with GLP-1RAs were chosen during the same period for the active-comparator group, and propensity scores with inverse probability of treatment weighting were applied to balance the baseline characteristics between the 2 treatment groups. Data analyses were conducted between February 2023 and April 2025. EXPOSURES: Treatment with SGLT2Is or GLP-1RAs. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was the incidence of MEGI, identified using International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification diagnosis codes. To examine the result consistency, subgroup analyses based on age (older or younger than 60 years), diabetes severity (insulin use or not), and kidney function were conducted.

This study aimed to critically examine the application of AI throughout the breast cancer care continuum to elucidate key research developments, emerging trends, and prevalent patterns. METHODS: English articles and reviews published between 1988 and 2024 were retrieved from the Web of Science database, focusing on studies that applied AI in breast cancer research. Collaboration among countries was analyzed using co-authorship networks and co-occurrence mapping. Additionally, clustering analysis using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) was conducted for topic modeling, whereas linear regression was employed to assess trends in research outputs over time. RESULTS: A total of 8,711 publications were included in the analysis. The United States has led the research in applying AI to the breast cancer care continuum, followed by China and India. Recent publications have increasingly focused on the utilization of deep learning and machine learning (ML) algorithms for automated breast cancer detection in mammography and histopathology. Moreover, the integration of multi-omics data and molecular profiling with AI has emerged as a significant trend. However, research on the applications of robotic and ML technologies in surgical oncology and postoperative care remains limited. Overall, the volume of research addressing AI for early detection, diagnosis, and classification of breast cancer has markedly increased over the past five years. CONCLUSIONS: The rapid expansion of AI-related research on breast cancer underscores its potential impact. However, significant challenges remain. Ongoing rigorous investigations are essential to ensure that AI technologies yield evidence-based benefits across diverse patient populations, thereby avoiding the inadvertent exacerbation of existing healthcare disparities.

10.3390/healthcare13182259	Real-World Safety Concerns of Tirzepatide: A Retrospective Analysis of FAERS Data	Almansour HA, Thaibah HA, Alfarhan M, Al-Qahtani SA, Khardali AA, Alshammari TM	Background: Tirzepatide (Mounjaro or Zepbound), a dual GLP-1/GIP receptor agonist, is approved for type 2 diabetes and weight management. Despite its efficacy, real-world safety data remain limited. This study analyzed post-marketing adverse events (AEs) associated with tirzepatide using the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) to identify emerging safety concerns. Methods: FAERS reports from 2022 to Q1 2025 were analyzed. Disproportionality analyses (proportional reporting ratio [PRR], reporting odds ratio [ROR], empirical Bayes geometric mean [EBGM], and information component [IC]) were performed to detect safety signals. Reports were stratified by year, demographics, and AE type, focusing on cases in which tirzepatide was the primary suspect. Results: Among 65,974 reports, the majority originated from the U.S. (96%), with middle-aged females (40-59 years; 67%) most frequently affected. Incorrect dose administration was the top AE, increasing 8-fold from 1248 (2022) to 9800 (2024), with strong risk signals (ROR 22.15, 95% CI (20.75-23.65), and ROR 23.43, 95% CI (22.82-24.05), respectively, and PRR 16.80, 95% CI (15.74-17.93), and PRR 17.62, 95% CI (17.16-18.09), respectively). Other common AEs included injection-site reactions (e.g., pain [5273 cases in 2024]), gastrointestinal issues (nausea [3602 in 2024]), and off-label use. Class-related AEs (e.g., decreased appetite and blood glucose fluctuations) were also reported. Conclusions: Tirzepatide is associated with significant dosing errors, injection-site reactions, and gastrointestinal AEs in real-world use. The rising trend in reports underscores the need for enhanced provider and patient education, clearer dosing guidelines, and proactive monitoring. Further research is warranted to explore causative factors and optimize risk mitigation strategies.	Healthcare (Basel, Switzerland)	9/09/2025
10.1371/journal.pone.0332876	Statin effect on arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy disease progression (SEARCH):	Sommariva E, Lippi M, Bruttini F, Cannata F, Baggiano A, Schiavone M, Salina G, Sabatino M, Vettor G, Sicuso R, Pizzamiglio F, Ribatti V, Maragna R, Carbucicchio C, DeLuca F, Catto V, Iezzi A, Salè EO, Valeri Y, Barbarossa A, Caiazza M, Monda E, Frisso G, Borrelli F, Gasperetti A, Turco A, De Luca L, Corino VDA, Galotta A, Bonomi A, Pompilio G, Pontone G, Muratori M, Limongelli G, Lombardi R, Casella M, Tondo C	Arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy (ACM) is an inherited cardiac disorder that predisposes affected individuals, especially young patients, to malignant arrhythmias, sudden cardiac death, and heart failure. The disease is characterized by myocardial atrophy and fibro-fatty replacement, predominantly affecting the right ventricle. Current pharmacological treatments primarily aim to alleviate symptoms by addressing arrhythmias and heart failure. These approaches are often complemented by invasive interventions such as implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) and radiofrequency ablations. However, none of these strategies effectively halts disease progression, highlighting the urgent need for novel disease-modifying therapies. We recently demonstrated that elevated plasma levels of oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) correlate with more advanced stages of ACM in patients. Moreover, treatment with atorvastatin, which reduces oxLDL levels, prevented disease manifestation in a mouse model of ACM. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that statins may attenuate disease progression in ACM patients not only through their lipid-lowering effects, but also via pleiotropic actions such as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and autonomic modulation. To test this hypothesis, we designed SEARCH (Statin Effect on ARrhythmogenic CardiomyopatHy), an investigator-initiated, multicenter, prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial, aimed at evaluating the efficacy of atorvastatin in preventing ACM progression (NCT06922994). A total of 102 patients meeting ACM diagnostic criteria will be enrolled and randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either atorvastatin 80 mg/die or placebo for 18 months. The primary outcome will be the change in right ventricular global longitudinal strain, a sensitive echocardiographic measure of ventricular function, from baseline to 18 months. Secondary outcomes will include changes in arrhythmic burden, electrocardiography parameters, additional structural and functional cardiac indices, and circulating biomarkers. Tertiary and exploratory outcomes include the validation of risk scores for ACM progression and the identification of variables predicting the best responders to atorvastatin. Participants will undergo a comprehensive evaluation at baseline, 9 months, and 18 months, including cardiology visits, echocardiography, electrocardiography, blood testing, ICD or loop recorder interrogation, and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (at enrollment and at 18 months only). Additional safety assessments and telephone follow-ups will be conducted throughout the study to monitor treatment adherence and potential adverse events. The SEARCH trial is expected to generate the first clinical evidence on the efficacy of atorvastatin in slowing ACM progression, thereby addressing a major unmet therapeutic need. The findings will shape the design of future large-scale studies and may pave the way for a novel, disease-modifying treatment strategy to improve outcomes and quality of life for patients with ACM.

10.1016/j.diabres.2025.112924	GLP-1 receptor agonists and sarcopenia: Weight loss at a cost? A brief narrative	Pantazopoulos D, Gouveri E, Papazoglou D, Papanas N	Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) and dual agonists targeting both GLP-1 and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide receptors (GLP-1/GIP RAs) are established therapies for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and obesity. However, there is evidence that treatment with these agents may lead to significant loss of muscle mass, potentially resulting in sarcopenia or sarcopenic obesity. This brief narrative review explores the complex relationship between GLP-1 based therapies and muscle health. Some studies have linked GLP-1 RAs and dual GLP-1/GIP RAs with significant reductions in lean mass, and sarcopenia. However, preclinical evidence suggests that these agents can attenuate skeletal muscle atrophy, improve muscle function, and enhance mitochondrial health. Moreover, limited clinical data indicate a potential role in preserving muscle mass under certain conditions. Management includes optimised diet, targeted exercise, and novel pharmacological interventions, such as blockade of growth differentiation factor-8 (GDF8) and activin A (ActA). These measures hold potential to preserve muscle mass and to improve patient outcomes. Further research is warranted to clarify these mechanisms and to evaluate combination therapies aimed at preventing sarcopenia in patients receiving GLP-1 RAs.

10.1177/17562848251375844	Efficacy and safety of Risankizumab for moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease: first	Chung CS, Chang CH, Kuo CJ, Chou JW, Huang TY, Hsu WH, Chang CW, Le PH	BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease (CD) remains a challenging condition, especially in patients with moderate-to-severe disease. Risankizumab (RZB), an anti-IL-23p19 monoclonal antibody, has shown efficacy in clinical trials. However, real-world data (RWD) in Asian populations are limited. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness and safety of Risankizumab in Asian patients with CD. DESIGN: Multicenter cohort study. METHODS: This study enrolled adult patients with moderate-to-severe CD who received Risankizumab between September 2024 and May 2025 in Taiwan. Efficacy was assessed at weeks 4, 8, and 12 using CD Activity Index (CDAI), patient-reported outcomes-2 (PRO2), and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)-disk scores. Safety outcomes and treatment response by prior biologic exposure, including Ustekinumab (UST), were evaluated. RESULTS: Forty-nine patients (mean age 41.5 years, 69.4% male) were included. Clinical response rates were 53.1%, 75.5%, and 91.8% at weeks 4, 8, and 12, respectively; clinical remission was achieved in 12.2%, 22.4%, and 42.9%. PRO2 remission reached 53.5% by week 12. Both CDAI and IBD-Disk scores improved at weeks 4, 8, and 12 with statistical significance (p < 0.0001). Transmural healing was observed in 16.3% of patients at week 12. Clinical remission at week 12 was consistent regardless of prior Ustekinumab exposure (exposed 36.36% vs naïve 44.74%, p = 0.630) or biologic-naïve status (exposed 36.84% vs naïve 63.63%, p = 0.119). No severe adverse events were reported, but mild events included headache and transient liver enzyme elevation (each 2.04%). CONCLUSION: Risankizumab may demonstrate significant short-term efficacy and favorable safety in real-world treatment of moderate-to-severe CD in an Asian cohort. Long-term data are needed to confirm sustained outcomes and guide their optimal use across diverse CD populations.	Therapeutic advances in gastroenterology	01/01/2025
10.1016/j.lanwpc.2025.101684	Pan-Asian consortium for treatment and research in ALS (PACTALS) guidelines for	Vucic S, Shahrizaila N, Kano O, Menon P, Agustini S, Kulkantrakorn K, Atchayaram N, Lee YC, Prado MB Jr, Ng KWP, Chai J, Son B, Talman P, Nghia HTT, Tuan LTQ, Shibuya K, Izumi Y, Atsuta N, Henderson RD, Cui L, Liu M, Ohnmar O, Rabani R, Hong YH, Sung JJ, Fan D, Raykar V, Kuwabara S, Kim SH, Sobue G, Kiernan MC	The Pan-Asian Consortium for Treatment and Research in ALS (PACTALS) guidelines were developed for the management of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients living in the Asia-Pacific countries, taking into consideration the ethnic, racial and economic diversity of the region. The majority of patients reside in low-income (limited-resource setting) and middle-income countries. Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology was utilised for development of the PACTALS management guidelines. Nine broad research questions, divided into sections, were addressed. Evidence was derived from existing Cochrane reviews, systematic reviews, meta-analysis, and randomized controlled trials (RCT) along with consensus when evidence was limited. Recommendations were provided for diagnostic pathways, use of disease modifying therapies, appropriateness of multidisciplinary care models, management of respiratory dysfunction, communication and nutrition, addressing symptoms that affect the quality of life, managing cognitive, behavioural and emotional symptoms as well as appropriate implementation of palliative care services and addressing end-of-life issues. The PACTALS guidelines provide a much-needed framework for the management of ALS patients living in the Asia-Pacific region. The management guidelines will be updated as the treatment landscape evolves and evidence of novel management approaches becomes available.	The Lancet regional health. Western Pacific	01/09/2025
10.1126/sciadv.ady5876	The polymerase-associated factor 1 complex modulates the growth-defense tradeoff	Guo Y, Li C, Liu Y, Mao H, Zhang Y, Genschik P, Wang L, Yan S	Plants have evolved sophisticated mechanisms to balance growth and defense. The evolutionarily conserved polymerase-associated factor 1 complex (PAF1C) plays multiple roles in transcription. Here, we show that PAF1C regulates the growth-defense tradeoff by repressing defense genes expression in Arabidopsis. Loss of PAF1C leads to increased expression of defense genes, enhanced disease resistance, but compromised growth. Mechanistically, PAF1C binds to defense genes, where it interacts with histone deacetylases, such as HDA6, to promote histone deacetylation, thereby repressing defense genes expression. The plant immune hormone salicylic acid (SA) promotes the interaction between PAF1 and the SA receptor NPR1, which functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase to mediate the polyubiquitination and degradation of PAF1. Genetically, loss of PAF1 suppresses the immune defects of the npr1 mutant, supporting the notion that PAF1 functions downstream of NPR1. Collectively, this study identifies the NPR1-PAF1C-HDA6 module that regulates the growth-defense tradeoff.	Science advances	26/09/2025
