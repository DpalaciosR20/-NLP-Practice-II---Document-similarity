10.1016/j.cell.2025.08.038	Multiscale proteomic modeling reveals protein networks driving Alzheimer's	Wang E, Yu K, Cao J, Wang M, Katsel P, Song WM, Wang Z, Li Y, Wang X, Wang Q, Xu P, Yu G, Zhu L, Geng J, Habibi P, Qian L, Tuck T, Li A, Tcw J, Roussos P, Brennand KJ, Haroutunian V, Johnson ECB, Seyfried NT, Levey AI, Bennett DA, Peng J, Cai D, Zhang B	The molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common form of dementia, remain poorly understood. Proteomics offers a crucial approach to elucidating AD pathogenesis, as alterations in protein expression are more directly linked to phenotypic outcomes than changes at the genetic or transcriptomic level. In this study, we develop multiscale proteomic network models for AD by integrating large-scale matched proteomic and genetic data from brain regions vulnerable to the disease. These models reveal detailed protein interaction structures and identify putative key driver proteins (KDPs) involved in AD progression. Notably, the network analysis uncovers an	Cell	2025 Sep 25

Here, we demonstrate the presence of pseudo-synaptic connections between sensory nerve endings and cancer cells in an extracerebral cancer, i.e., pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). These synaptic sites exhibit a selective enrichment of the glutamatergic N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDA) receptor subunit NMDAR2D (GRIN2D) on the cancer cells, which turns PDAC cells responsive to neuron-derived glutamate and promotes tumor growth and spread. Intriguingly, neurons transform a subset of co-cultured PDAC cells into calcium-responsive cells via GRIN2D-type glutamate receptors at the neuron-cancer pseudo-synapses. We found that the expression of this subunit is due to the increased glutamate availability provided by sensory innervation in a neurotrophic feedforward loop. Moreover, interference with the glutamate-GRIN2D signaling at these neuron-cancer pseudo-synapses markedly improved survival in vivo. This discovery of peripheral cancer-neuron pseudo-synapses may provide an opportunity for cancer-neuroscience-instructed oncological therapies.	Cancer cell	2025 Sep 25
10.1016/j.ccell.2025.09.002	Ketogenic diet inhibits glioma progression by promoting gut microbiota-derived	Chen ML, He Y, Dong XH, Liu HF, Yan ZX, Lu XL, Miao QQ, Zhao QN, Zhang H, Luo L, Wang S, Li JY, Xiang DF, Lin Y, Li TR, Zhou XY, Zhou YY, Mao M, Zhang X, Wei H, Shi Y, Liu XD, Ping YF, Bian XW	The ketogenic diet (KD) is a potential therapeutic strategy for glioma; however, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Herein, we first identify that glioma patients exhibit a distinct gut microbial profile characterized by reduced butyrate-producing bacteria abundance, particularly R. faecis, along with decreased butyrate levels. Notably, KD reshapes the gut microbiota especially enriching A. muciniphila in a mucin-2-dependent manner, elevates butyrate production, and activates caspase-3 in microglia. These changes promote an anti-tumor microglial phenotype, ultimately suppressing glioma progression in mice. Crucially, KD's anti-glioma effect is notably abolished by antibiotics treatment; germ-free condition; or specific depletion of mucin-2, microglia, or microglial caspase-3. Furthermore, butyrate, A. muciniphila, R. faecis, or A. muciniphila plus R. faecis restores KD-induced microglial caspase-3 activation and the anti-tumor phenotype of microglia in antibiotics-treated or germ-free mice. These findings highlight that targeting the gut microbiota by KD or supplementing with butyrate could be an effective strategy for glioma therapy.	Cancer cell	2025 Sep 25
10.1016/j.cmet.2025.09.001	Catenibacteriummitsuokai promotes hepatocellular carcinogenesis by binding to	Zhang Y, Liu W, Wong CC, Song Q, Zhang X, Zhou Q, Ren X, Ren X, Xuan R, Zhao Y, Xu L, Li X, Xu L, Zhang X, Kuang M, Yu J	The role of gut microbes in the pathogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unclear. Here, we identified that Catenibacterium is enriched in both the feces and tumors of patients with HCC. C. mitsuokai accelerated HCC carcinogenesis in both conventional and germ-free mice. Furthermore, C. mitsuokai disrupted the gut barrier and translocated to the liver as live bacteria. Critically, the C. mitsuokai surface protein Gtr1/RagA interacts with the γ-catenin receptor on HCC cells, facilitating its attachment and colonization in the mouse liver. We further revealed that the pro-tumorigenic effect of C. mitsuokai depends on its secreted metabolite, quinolinic acid. Mechanistically, quinolinic acid binds to and activates the tyrosine kinase with immunoglobulin and epidermal growth factor homology domains 2 (TIE2) on HCC cells. Phosphorylated TIE2 subsequently activates the downstream oncogenic phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/AKT) pathway, thereby promoting HCC progression. In summary, C. mitsuokai disrupts the gut barrier, colonizes HCC cells via Gtr1/RagA-γ-catenin, and secretes quinolinic acid, which binds to TIE2 and drives the PI3K/AKT pathway to promote HCC development.

10.1111/ppe.12615	Acetaminophen use during pregnancy and the risk of attention deficit	Masarwa R, Platt RW, Filion KB	BACKGROUND: The association between acetaminophen use during pregnancy and the development of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in the offspring may be due to bias. OBJECTIVES: The primary objective was to assess the role of potential unmeasured confounding in the estimation of the association between acetaminophen use during pregnancy and the risk of ADHD, through bias analysis. The secondary objective was to assess the roles of selection bias and exposure misclassification. DATA SOURCES: We searched MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library up to December 2018. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: We included observational studies examining the association between acetaminophen use during pregnancy and the risk of ADHD. SYNTHESIS: We meta-analysed data across studies, using random-effects model. We conducted a bias analysis to studies that did not adjust for important confounders, to explore systematic errors related to unmeasured confounding, selection bias, and exposure misclassification. RESULTS: The search resulted in seven studies included in our meta-analysis. When adjusted estimates were pooled across all studies, the risk ratio (RR) for ADHD was 1.35 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.25, 1.46; I(2) = 48%). Sensitivity analysis for unmeasured confounding in this meta-analysis showed that a confounder of 1.69 on the RR scale would reduce to 10% the proportion of studies with a true effect size of RR >1.10. Unmeasured confounding bias analysis decreased the point estimate in five of the seven studies and increased in two studies, suggesting that the observed association could be confounded by parental ADHD. Unadjusted and bias-corrected risk ratios (bcRRs) were: RR = 1.34, bcRR = 1.13; RR = 1.51, bcRR = 1.17; RR = 1.63, bcRR = 1.38; RR = 1.44, bcRR = 1.17; RR = 1.16, bcRR = 1.18; RR = 1.25, bcRR = 1.05; and RR = 0.99, bcRR = 1.18. CONCLUSIONS: Bias analysis suggests that the previously reported association between acetaminophen use during pregnancy and an increased risk of ADHD in the offspring may be due to unmeasured confounding. Our ability to conclude a causal association is limited.	Paediatric and perinatal epidemiology	2020 May
10.1016/j.chroma.2018.01.015	Profiling of polyunsaturated fatty acids in human serum using off-line and	Gu WY, Liu MX, Sun BQ, Guo MQ, Wu JL, Li N	Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) play a pivotal role in the biological effects, and are the potential biomarkers for some diseases. However, the structural diversity and similarity, the low concentration, and the interference of high abundant endogenous components challenge the PUFAs profiling. Herein, a novel analytical approach, off-line and on-line solid phase extraction-nano-liquid chromatography-quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (off-line and on-line SPE-nano-LC-Q-TOF-MS), was established to monitor the PUFAs. The combination of off-line and on-line SPE removed most of impurities, and the recoveries ranged from 80.1% to 93.0% and the matrix effects were from 85.1% to 92.8%. Using this method, 51 PUFAs could be separated well and quantified with the limits of quantification between 0.006 and 2.2 pg. Finally, this developed method was applied successfully to simultaneously qualify and quantify the potential biomarkers in the allergic patients. 21 PUFAs including LTB(4,) 5S-, 11S-, 15S-HETE and 15S-HEPE showed significant differences. Our study indicated that the established method has the potential to sensitively and accurately determine the PUFAs in biological samples.	Journal of chromatography. A	2018 Feb 16
10.1016/j.cell.2018.05.051	Common Disease Is More Complex Than Implied by the Core Gene Omnigenic Model.	Wray NR, Wijmenga C, Sullivan PF, Yang J, Visscher PM	"The evidence that most adult-onset common diseases have a polygenic genetic architecture fully consistent with robust biological systems supported by multiple back-up mechanisms is now overwhelming. In this context, we consider the recent ""omnigenic"" or ""core genes"" model. A key assumption of the model is that there is a relatively small number of core genes relevant to any disease. While intuitively appealing, this model may underestimate the biological complexity of common disease, and therefore, the goal to discover core genes should not guide experimental design. We consider other implications of polygenicity, concluding that a focus on patient stratification is needed to achieve the goals of precision medicine."	Cell	2018 Jun 14
10.1111/sjop.12866	Relation between resilience and personality traits: The role of hopelessness and	Nieto M, Visier ME, Silvestre IN, Navarro B, Serrano JP, Martínez-Vizcaíno V	Resilience refers to the process by which individuals use the ability to cope with challenges to successfully adapt to adverse situations, inclining towards the future and hope. The main aim of this study was to analyze the relation between resilience, personality traits, and hopelessness. Furthermore, we conducted comparisons between two age groups: young and older adults. The sample comprised 439 Spanish participants (66.7% women; M = 43.73, SD = 26.41; age range = 18-98 years). The Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale, NEO-Five Factor Inventory, and Beck Hopelessness Scale were used to measure the main study variables. The results revealed a negative relation between resilience and neuroticism, and a positive association with the other personality traits. Additionally, levels of resilience were found to be negatively related to hopelessness. The group of older adults showed significantly lower resilience levels than the young adults, although age was not a significant predictor of resilience. Neuroticism, extraversion, openness, and hopelessness were the only predictors of resilience for the current study. This work contributes to the study of resilience and related factors, by attempting to understand the role of resilience and resistance to risk and how individuals tackle challenges over time, with important implications for mental health.

10.1186/s40364-025-00831-w	1-year risks of cancers associated with COVID-19 vaccination: a large	Kim HJ, Kim MH, Choi MG, Chun EM	The oncogenic potential of SARS-CoV-2 has been hypothetically proposed, but real-world data on COVID-19 infection and vaccination are insufficient. Therefore, this large-scale population-based retrospective study in Seoul, South Korea, aimed to estimate the cumulative incidences and subsequent risks of overall cancers 1 year after COVID-19 vaccination. Data from 8,407,849 individuals between 2021 and 2023 were obtained from the Korean National Health Insurance database. The participants were categorized into two groups based on their COVID-19 vaccination status. The risks for overall cancer were assessed using multivariable Cox proportional hazards models, and data were expressed as hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The HRs of thyroid (HR, 1.351; 95% CI, 1.206-1.514), gastric (HR, 1.335; 95% CI, 1.130-1.576), colorectal (HR, 1.283; 95% CI, 1.122-1.468), lung (HR, 1.533; 95% CI, 1.254-1.874), breast (HR, 1.197; 95% CI, 1.069-1.340), and prostate (HR, 1.687; 95% CI, 1.348-2.111) cancers significantly increased at 1 year post-vaccination. In terms of vaccine type, cDNA vaccines were associated with the increased risks of thyroid, gastric, colorectal, lung, and prostate cancers; mRNA vaccines were linked to the increased risks of thyroid, colorectal, lung, and breast cancers; and heterologous vaccination was related to the increased risks of thyroid and breast cancers. Given the observed associations between COVID-19 vaccination and cancer incidence by age, sex, and vaccine type, further research is needed to determine whether specific vaccination strategies may be optimal for populations in need of COVID-19 vaccination.

10.1016/j.cell.2025.09.001	Safe immunosuppression-resistant pan-cancer immunotherapeutics by velcro-like	Zhou RW, Purohit PK, Kim JH, Lee SU, Burshteyn N, Tifrea D, Cordon A, Grigorian A, Newton BL, Edwards RA, Demetriou M	"Bispecific antibodies and chimeric antigen receptor T cells are some of the most potent cancer immunotherapeutics in clinical use, yet most cancers remain poorly targetable. High-affinity antibodies required to maximize killing detect low antigen expression in normal tissue, risking ""on-target, off-cancer"" toxicity. This compels identification of cancer-restricted cell-surface protein antigens, which are rare. Tumor-associated carbohydrate antigens (TACAs) are the most abundant and widespread cancer antigens known but are poorly targetable by antibodies. Here, we describe glycan-dependent T cell recruiter (GlyTR) pan-cancer immunotherapeutics that utilize high-avidity ""velcro-like"" lectin binding to kill cells with high but not low TACA expression. GlyTR1 and GlyTR2 bind immunosuppressive β1,6GlcNAc-branched N-glycans or multiple TACAs (Tn, sialyl-Tn, LacDiNAc, and GD2), respectively, overcome immunosuppressive mechanisms in the tumor microenvironment and trigger target-density-dependent T cell-mediated pan-cancer killing, yet they lack toxicity in mice with human-like TACA expression. Density-dependent lectin binding to TACAs provides highly potent and safe pan-cancer immunotherapeutics."	Cell	2025 Sep 25
10.1016/j.jare.2025.09.039	Global, regional, and national burden of cardiovascular diseases among	Xu S, Jia S, Yang S, Li D, Zhang E, Lei F, Zeng ML, Lin L	BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) remain the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. In postmenopausal women, physiological changes and hormonal transitions accelerate cardiovascular risk, yet global, sex-specific evidence for this group remains limited. Understanding their burden is essential to address biological vulnerabilities and structural inequities. AIM OF REVIEW: This review provides the first comprehensive global, regional, and national assessment of CVD burden among women aged ≥ 55 years from 1990 to 2021 and projects trends to 2040. It synthesizes epidemiological patterns, socio-demographic disparities, and major modifiable risk factors, with the goal of informing gender-sensitive and equity-oriented cardiovascular prevention and policy strategies. KEY SCIENTIFIC CONCEPTS OF REVIEW: Data were obtained from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Study 2021, encompassing 204 countries and territories. Incidence, prevalence, mortality, and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) were analyzed using age-standardized rates (ASRs). Temporal trends were quantified with estimated annual percentage changes (EAPCs), and decomposition analysis identified demographic (population growth, aging) and epidemiological contributions. Inequalities were evaluated using slope and concentration indices across socio-demographic index (SDI) levels. Bayesian age-period-cohort models were applied to forecast CVD burden through 2040. Key findings indicate that although ASIR and ASMR declined globally, absolute CVD cases and deaths nearly doubled due to demographic expansion. Disparities widened: high-SDI regions achieved the steepest reductions, while low-SDI regions showed slower progress or worsening trends. Ischemic heart disease and stroke remained the dominant contributors, endocarditis was the fastest-rising subtype, and high systolic blood pressure consistently emerged as the leading modifiable risk factor. Collectively, these findings highlight a growing and uneven burden of CVD in postmenopausal women. Strengthened hypertension control, integrated prevention strategies, and investment in primary healthcare-particularly in low-SDI settings-are urgently needed. This review provides a woman-centered evidence base to support equitable cardiovascular health policy and resource allocation.	Journal of advanced research	2025 Sep 24

10.1186/s13045-025-01739-6	Combination immunotherapy in hepatocellular carcinoma: synergies among immune	Dai S, Chen Y, Cai W, Dong S, Zhao J, Chen L, Cheng CS	Combination therapy is rapidly becoming the cornerstone of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treatment. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have emerged as a central strategy in systemic therapy, yet their efficacy as monotherapies remains limited. Consequently, combinatorial approaches, such as ICIs-Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), ICIs-chemotherapy, and dual ICI regimens, are gaining momentum. While clinical trials have established efficacy benchmarks, mechanistic insights remain scarce, partly due to the limitations of current preclinical models in mimicking the complex tumor microenvironment (TME). Given the substantial heterogeneity of HCC, spanning genetic, transcriptomic, and immunologic dimensions, treatment outcomes vary widely. Additional factors such as gut microbiota and epigenetic modifications further influence therapeutic response and resistance. Although PD-1, PD-L1, and CTLA-4 inhibitors are widely used, unresponsiveness is common. Novel targets such as LAG-3, TIM-3, TIGIT, and VISTA, as well as strategies to reprogram fibrotic and immunosuppressive TME, are under active investigation. Ultimately, translating basic insights into personalized therapy will depend on predictive biomarkers and integrated analyses that account for the complex interactions among tumor cells, the immune system, and the TME. This review synthesizes current knowledge and cellular mechanisms underpinning combination therapies, highlights therapeutic synergies, and discusses emerging directions for stratified treatment in HCC.

10.1159/000480657	Geniposide Attenuates Post-Ischaemic Neurovascular Damage via GluN2A/AKT/	Huang B, Chen P, Huang L, Li S, Zhu R, Sheng T, Yu W, Chen Z, Wang T	BACKGROUND/AIMS: Calcium-permeable ionotropic NMDAR-mediated hyperactivity is regarded as the critical factor in modulating the development of ischaemic stroke. Recently, there has been increasing interest in preventing post-stroke neuronal death by focusing on intervening in the function of subpopulations of NMDARs and their downstream signalling. Geniposide, an iridoid glycoside, has been found to have cytoprotective functions in various conditions. However, it is still unclear whether and how geniposide affects neuronal insult under experimental stroke. METHODS: We demonstrate that dose-dependent geniposide significantly decreased the infarct volume in tMCAO models. RESULTS: A medium level of geniposide improved anti-apoptotic functions and inhibited BBB leakage/haemorrhage via elevating GluN2A-containing NMDAR expression in tMCAO rats. Importantly, these effects could be eliminated by co-treatment of geniposide with the GluN2A antagonist NVP but not the GluN2B inhibitor ifenprodil. Moreover, geniposide's protection was due to the enhancement of GluN2A-dependent survival signals, including pAKT, pERK and PSD-95. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that geniposide protects neurons against post-ischaemic neurovascular injury through the activation of GluN2A/AKT/ERK pathways. As a very promising natural agent, geniposide may be a future therapeutic for stroke patients.	Cellular physiology and biochemistry : international journal of experimental	2017
10.1038/s41586-025-09574-y	SPP1 is required for maintaining mesenchymal cell fate in pancreatic cancer.	Li H, Lan L, Chen H, Zaw Thin M, Ps H, Nelson JK, Evans IM, Ruiz EJ, Cheng R, Tran L, Allen M, Ma J, Yi T, Wang C, He Y, Guppy N, Sadanandam A, Lin SZ, Zhang C, Behrens A	Elucidating the complex network of communication between tumour cells is central to understanding cell fate decisions and progression of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC)(1,2). We previously showed that constant suppression of BMP activity by the BMP antagonist GREM1 secreted by mesenchymal PDAC cells is essential for maintaining the fate of epithelial PDAC cells(3). Here we identify SPP1 (also known as osteopontin)(4) as a key regulator of mesenchymal cell fate in pancreatic cancer. Proteomic analysis of plasma from patients with PDAC showed that SPP1 is substantially upregulated in late-stage disease. Inactivation of Spp1 led to a delay in tumorigenesis in mouse PDAC models and abolished metastasis formation. Spp1 was expressed in epithelial PDAC cells, and Spp1 inactivation resulted in a conversion of mesenchymal to epithelial PDAC cells. Mechanistically, SPP1 bound the CD61 receptor on mesenchymal PDAC cells to induce Bmp2 and Grem1 expression, and GREM1 inhibition of BMP signalling was required for Spp1 expression in epithelial cells, thereby forming an intercellular regulatory loop. Concomitant inactivation of Grem1 reverted the epithelial phenotype of Spp1 knockout to fully mesenchymal PDAC. Conversely, Grem1 heterozygosity combined with Spp1 knockout resulted in wild-type PDAC histology, a result that confirmed the direct antagonistic functions of these factors. Hence, mesenchymal and epithelial PDAC cell fates are determined by the reciprocal paracrine regulation of the soluble factors GREM1 and SPP1.	Nature	2025 Sep 24
10.1016/S0140-6736(25)01148-1	Oral iptacopan therapy in patients with C3 glomerulopathy: a randomised,	Kavanagh D, Bomback AS, Vivarelli M, Nester CM, Remuzzi G, Zhao MH, Wong EKS, Wang Y, Krishnan I, Schuhmann I, Trapani AJ, Webb NJA, Meier M, Israni RK, Smith RJH	BACKGROUND: C3 glomerulopathy is an ultra-rare, severe form of glomerulonephritis caused by overactivation of the alternative complement pathway. We aimed to assess efficacy and safety of iptacopan (LNP023), an oral, proximal complement inhibitor that targets factor B to selectively inhibit the alternative pathway of the complement cascade. METHODS: APPEAR-C3G was a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 study of iptacopan versus placebo (both in addition to supportive care [renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors] and immunosuppression). Adult participants (aged 18-60 years) with biopsy-confirmed C3 glomerulopathy were enrolled from 35 hospitals or medical centres in 18 countries. Inclusion criteria included reduced serum C3 concentration (ie, <77 mg/dL [defined as <0·85 × lower limit of the central laboratory normal range]) at screening, urine protein-creatinine ratio (UPCR) of 1·0 g/g or higher at day -75 and day -15 before randomisation, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 30 mL/min per 1·73 m(2) or higher at screening and day -15, and vaccination against Neisseria meningitidis and Streptococcus pneumoniae. All eligible participants were randomised 1:1 via interactive response technology to either the iptacopan or the placebo group, stratified by treatment with corticosteroids, mycophenolic acid, or both (yes or no). During the 6-month double-blind period, participants orally received either iptacopan 200 mg twice daily or placebo; this was followed by a 6-month open-label period in which all participants received iptacopan 200 mg twice daily. The primary endpoint was relative reduction in proteinuria (measured by log-transformed ratio to baseline in UPCR sampled from a 24-h urine collection) at 6 months. The primary analyses were done in the full analysis set (ie, all participants to whom study treatment was assigned by randomisation); all participants who received at least one dose of study treatment were included in the safety analysis. This trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04817618) and the adult cohort has been completed. FINDINGS: Between July 28, 2021, and Feb 15, 2023, 132 participants were screened, of whom 58 did not complete the screening period and 74 (64% male; 69% White) were randomised 1:1 to receive either iptacopan (n=38) or placebo (n=36). One participant in the placebo group discontinued treatment during the open-label period. The 24-h UPCR percentage change relative to baseline at 6 months was -30·2% (95% CI -42·8 to -14·8) in the iptacopan group and 7·6% (-11·9 to 31·3) in the placebo group. In the iptacopan group, the geometric mean of 24-h UPCR was 3·33 g/g (95% CI 2·79 to 3·97) at baseline and 2·17 g/g (1·62 to 2·91) at 6 months; in the placebo group, this was 2·58 g/g (2·18 to 3·05) at baseline and 2·80 g/g (2·37 to 3·30) at 6 months. The primary endpoint was met with a relative reduction in 24-h UPCR at 6 months for iptacopan versus placebo of 35·1% (13·8 to 51·1; p=0·0014). 30 (79%) of 38 participants in the iptacopan group had treatment-emergent adverse events, compared with 24 (67%) of 36 participants in the placebo group; most of these were of mild or moderate severity. There were no deaths, no treatment discontinuations due to treatment-emergent adverse events, and no meningococcal infections. Serious adverse events were reported in three (8%) participants in the iptacopan group and one (3%) participant in the placebo group. INTERPRETATION: Iptacopan showed a statistically significant, clinically meaningful proteinuria reduction in addition to RAAS inhibitors and immunosuppression at 6 months. Iptacopan was well tolerated with an acceptable safety profile in patients with C3 glomerulopathy. FUNDING: Novartis Pharma.	Lancet (London, England)	2025 Sep 25
10.1088/1361-6560/aca3f8	Experimental feasibility of xenon-enhanced dual-energy radiography for imaging of	Basharat F, Tanguay J	Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a leading cause of death worldwide. We experimentally investigated the feasibility of two-dimensional xenon-enhanced dual-energy (XeDE) radiography for imaging of lung function. We optimized image quality under quantum-noise-limited conditions using a chest phantom consisting of a rectangular chamber representing the thoracic volume and PMMA slabs simulating x-ray attenuation by soft tissue. A sealed, air-filled cavity with thin PMMA walls was positioned inside the chamber to simulate a 2 cm thick ventilation defect. The chamber was ventilated with xenon and dual-energy imaging was performed using a diagnostic x-ray tube and a flat-panel detector. The contrast-to-noise ratio of ventilation defects normalized by patient x-ray exposure maximized at a kV-pair of approximately 60/140-kV and when approximately one third of the total exposure was allocated to the HE image. We used the optimized technique to image a second phantom that contained lung-parenchyma-mimicking PMMA clutter, rib-mimicking aluminum slats and an insert that simulated ventilation defects with thicknesses ranging from 0.5 cm to 2 cm and diameters ranging from 1 cm to 2 cm. From the resulting images we computed the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of the non-prewhitening model observer with an eye filter and internal noise. For a xenon concentration of 75%, good AUCs (i.e. 0.8-0.9) to excellent AUCs (i.e. >0.9) were obtained when the defect diameter is greater than 1.3 cm and defect thickness is 1 cm. When the xenon concentration was reduced to 50%, the AUC was ∼0.9 for defects 1.2 cm in diameter and ∼1.5 cm in thickness. Two-dimensional XeDE radiography may therefore enable detection of functional abnormalities associated with early-stage COPD, for which xenon ventilation defects can occupy up to 20% of the lung volume, and should be further developed as a low-cost alternative to MRI-based approaches and a low-dose alternative to CT-based approaches.

10.1016/j.ccell.2025.09.001	Single-cell resolution spatial analysis of antigen-presenting cancer-associated	Chen X, Zhou Z, Xie L, Qiao K, Jia Y, Liu S, Yazgan Z, Rossi F, Liu Y, Zhang B, Polanco PM, Zeh HJ 3rd, Kim AC, Huang H	Recent studies identify a unique subtype of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) termed antigen-presenting CAFs (apCAFs), which remain poorly understood. To gain a comprehensive understanding of the origin and function of apCAFs, we construct a fibroblast molecular atlas across 15 types of tissues and solid tumors. Our integration study unexpectedly reveals two distinct apCAF populations present in most cancer types: one associated with mesothelial-like cells and the other with fibrocytes. Using a high-resolution single-cell spatial imaging platform, we characterize the spatial niches of these apCAF populations. We find that mesothelial-like apCAFs are located near cancer cells, while fibrocyte-like apCAFs are associated with lymphocyte-enriched niches. Additionally, we discovered that both apCAF populations can up-regulate secreted phosphoprotein 1 (SPP1), which facilitates primary tumor formation, peritoneal metastasis, and therapy resistance. Taken together, this study offers an unprecedented resolution in analyzing apCAFs and their spatial niches.	Cancer cell	2025 Sep 25

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the possible relationships among gut metagenomics, plasma metabolomics and attention. DESIGN: We conducted faecal shotgun metagenomics and targeted plasma tryptophan metabolomics across three independent cohorts (n=156, n=124, n=804) with functional validations in preclinical models, including three faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) experiments in mice and Drosophila melanogaster. RESULTS: Obesity was consistently associated with reduced attention. Metagenomics analyses identified Proteobacteria species and microbial functions related to tryptophan biosynthesis from anthranilic acid (AA) as negatively associated with attention in obesity. Plasma tryptophan metabolic profiling and machine learning revealed that 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid (3-HAA) was positively associated with attention, particularly in obesity, while AA showed a negative association. Bariatric surgery improved attention and enriched microbial species linked to attention. In mice, diet-induced obesity (DIO) and microbiota depletion reduced 3-HAA and 5-hydroxy-indole acetic acid (5-HIAA) concentrations in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), which were restored by FMT. Global metabolic profiling (>600 metabolites) of PFC from the FMT group identified 3-HAA and the tryptophan and tyrosine pathways among the most significant in mice receiving microbiota from high-attention donors. A second FMT experiment also revealed a consistent enrichment of the tryptophan and tyrosine metabolism at the transcriptional level in the PFC, with Haao (3-hydroxyantrhanilic acid dioxygenase) and Aox4 (aldehyde oxidase 4), key in 3-HAA and 5-HIAA degradation, among the significantly regulated genes. In a third FMT study, attentional traits were transmitted from humans to mice alongside modulation of serotonergic and dopaminergic pathways. In Drosophila, mono-colonisation with Enterobacter cloacae and DIO induced attention deficit-like behaviours, which were mitigated by 3-HAA supplementation. CONCLUSIONS: We have identified the microbiota and 3-HAA as potential therapeutic targets to improve attention, especially in obesity.	Gut	2025 Sep 27

Chen B, Wang W, Shi J, Sun X, Guan Y, Hao G, Zhao J, Mu J, Zhang Z, Xu F, Gao D, Pan Z, Yu R, Gu H, Fan H, Luo Y, Xie S, Du X, Jing H, Ye Z, Zhang X, Hai R, Zhu H, Wu T, Li Q, Fu J, Wu L, Wang W, Li C, Diao F, Shi Q, Li L, Xu S, Li D, Dong X, Xu P, Wang J, He L, Kuang Y, Sang Q, Wang L	Oocyte/embryo defects can result in oocyte maturation arrest, fertilization failure, embryonic arrest, and infertility as well as recurrent in vitro fertilization (IVF) or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) failures. However, the genetic determinants of human oocyte/embryo defects remain largely unknown, and the overall genetic diagnostic yield for such defects has not been evaluated. Here, we performed exome sequencing in 3,627 patients with oocyte/embryo defects. We identified a total of 479 positive cases carrying variants in 37 known genes, indicating a diagnostic yield of 13.2%. Case-control association studies combined with gene set enrichment analysis identified 123 novel candidate genes responsible for oocyte/embryo defects. These results provide a comprehensive genetic landscape of human oocyte/embryo defects and highlight the clinical significance of genetic counseling in infertile patients with oocyte/embryo defects. Our study will lay the foundation for transforming the traditional clinical practice for failed IVF/ICSI attempts into genetic-based precision and personalized treatment for these patients.

Li M, Huang L, Chen J, Guan T, Wen Y, Zhu Y, Yang X, Zhang C, Ma X, Wan R, He Y, Zhou Y, Song Y, Zhang H, Liu T	The von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) protein (pVHL) functions as a potent tumor suppressor by mediating the degradation or inactivation of various substrates, including HIFα and Akt. However, pVHL is frequently downregulated in numerous cancers harboring wild-type VHL, and underlying mechanisms remains elusive. Aberrant glucose metabolism is a hallmark of cancer, driving tumor progression and therapeutic resistance. Despite this, the connection between glucose homoeostasis and pVHL turnover and functions has yet to be defined. In this study, we demonstrate that dysregulated glucose metabolism destabilizes pVHL in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), colorectal, and ovarian cancer cells. Mechanistically, energy stress induced by glucose starvation, 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG), or metformin activates AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which subsequently phosphorylates and activates BAP1, a deubiquitinase whose specific function in targeting pVHL for deubiquitination and stabilization had not been previously characterized. Specifically, AMPKα phosphorylates BAP1 at residues S123, S469, and S583, enhancing the interaction between BAP1 and pVHL and promoting pVHL stabilization and tumor-suppressive function both in vitro and in vivo. Conversely, disrupting BAP1 phosphorylation through AMPKα depletion or reconstitution with a phosphorylation-defective BAP1 mutant (S123A/S469A/S583A) abolishes the BAP1-pVHL interaction, leading to impaired pVHL stabilization and accelerated tumor progression in cancer cell lines and patient-derived xenograft models. Clinically, our analysis reveals a positive correlation between levels of phosphorylated AMPKα (p-AMPKα), phosphorylated Ser123-BAP1 (pSer123-BAP1), and pVHL levels in PDAC, colorectal cancer, and ovarian cancer specimens. Collectively, these findings elucidate a novel mechanism linking dysregulated glucose metabolism to compromised function of the BAP1-pVHL tumor-suppressive axis. Our results suggest that therapeutic strategies designed to activate this pathway may represent a promising approach for treating cancers characterized by downregulated wild-type VHL and aberrant glucose metabolism.

10.1038/s41392-025-02409-2	Tumor microenvironment delineates differential responders to trastuzumab	Pan H, Wang J, Sun Y, Li F, Sun C, Liu M, Xu H, Tao J, Mao X, Wang C, Wang S, Li W, Ding Q, Zhou W	Trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) has been approved for the treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer. However, the efficacy of T-DM1 for patients after failure of pyrotinib and/or trastuzumab plus pertuzumab has not been clear. Additionally, no biomarker has been reported to predict the effect of T-DM1. In this multicenter phase II trial (NCT06125834), 36 participants with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer were enrolled to receive T-DM1 therapy on a 21-day cycle until progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary endpoint was the objective response rate (ORR). The secondary endpoints included the disease control rate (DCR), clinical benefit rate (CBR), progression-free survival (PFS), and toxicity. The primary endpoint was an ORR of 47.2% (17/36, 95% CI 30.4-64.5). The treatment exhibited a manageable toxicity profile. The DCR was 66.7% (24/36, 95% CI 49.0-81.4), and the CBR was 50.0% (18/36, 95% CI 32.9-67.1). The median PFS was 6.6 (95% CI 5.2-NA) months. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that the low cell cycle activity of cancer cells, activated macrophages and CD8+ T cells was associated with the good efficacy of T-DM1, which was validated in a neoadjuvant cohort. This study suggests that T-DM1 is effective with a measurable safety profile in patients with metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer after failure of pyrotinib and/or trastuzumab plus pertuzumab. Our preliminary findings suggest potential biomarkers that may help predict T-DM1 efficacy, generating hypotheses for novel therapeutic targets that may address T-DM1 resistance.

Exacerbations and daily symptoms have the largest impact on patients and healthcare systems, and they are the key focus of treatments. Current practice is heterogeneous globally, and bronchiectasis has historically been a neglected disease. Here, we present evidence-based international guidelines for the management of adults with bronchiectasis. METHODS: A European Respiratory Society (ERS) Task Force, comprising global experts, a methodologist, and patient representatives, developed clinical practice guidelines in accordance with ERS methodology and the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations) approach. Systematic literature searches, data extraction, and meta-analysis were performed to generate evidence tables, and recommendations were formulated using the evidence-to-decision framework. A total of 8 PICO (Patient, Intervention, Comparator, Outcomes) questions and 3 narrative questions were developed. RECOMMENDATIONS: The Task Force recommendations include strong recommendations in favour of airway clearance techniques for most patients with bronchiectasis and pulmonary rehabilitation for those with impaired exercise capacity. We issue a strong recommendation for the use of long-term macrolide treatment for patients at high risk of exacerbations and a strong recommendation in favour of long-term inhaled antibiotics in patients with chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection at high risk of exacerbation. Conditional recommendations support the use of eradication treatment or mucoactive drugs in specific circumstances. We suggest not to routinely use long term oral, non-macrolide antibiotic treatment or inhaled corticosteroids. Additional guidance is also provided on testing for underlying causes, managing exacerbations, and managing the deteriorating patient. CONCLUSION: The ERS bronchiectasis guidelines provide an evidence-based framework for optimal management of adults with bronchiectasis and serve as a benchmark for evaluating the quality of care. SCOPE AND OBJECTIVES: The European Respiratory Society (ERS) guidelines for the management of bronchiectasis in adults provide evidence-based recommendations for the care of people with clinically significant bronchiectasis, defined by the presence of permanent dilatation of the bronchi evident on chest CT scan, along with characteristic clinical symptoms. [1] These guidelines are intended for all healthcare professionals involved in the care of adults with bronchiectasis, as well as for policymakers, regulatory authorities, and pharmaceutical companies. Bronchiectasis is a complex and heterogeneous disease; therefore, no guideline can be entirely comprehensive or replace clinical judgement. All guideline recommendations must be interpreted within the specific clinical context in which they are applied. Separate ERS guidelines for the management of bronchiectasis in children exist [2]. Bronchiectasis due to cystic fibrosis (CF) has a distinct evidence base; therefore, guidance for the management of CF is provided elsewhere. [3] Some bronchiectasis-associated conditions also have distinct guidelines for investigation and management, such as primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) [4], allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) [5] and non-tuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) pulmonary disease [6]. While the present guidelines apply for these conditions, they should be interpreted in conjunction with the relevant syndrome-specific recommendations.	The European respiratory journal	2025 Sep 28
10.1016/j.phymed.2025.157284	Atractylenolide III alleviates cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury by targeting	Guo R, Quan S, Yan X, Jia Y, Wang N, Bu J, Zhao Y, Su L, Yue Z, Wang J, Li Z, Li Y	BACKGROUND: Atractylenolide III (ATL III), a natural sesquiterpene lactone, exhibits neuroprotective properties against cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury (CIRI), but its underlying mechanism remains unclear. PURPOSE: To identify the pharmacological target and elucidate the mechanism of ATL III in CIRI protection. METHODS: Middle cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion (MCAO/R) in mice and oxygen-glucose deprivation/reperfusion (OGD/R) in HT22 cells were employed to evaluate the protective effects of ATL III on neurological function, oxidative stress, and apoptosis. Network pharmacology, molecular docking, surface plasmon resonance, and molecular dynamics were used to identify its direct target. Molecular mechanisms were validated using Western blot, immunofluorescence, and a pharmacological inhibitor both in vitro and in vivo. RESULTS: ATL III (10, 20, 40 mg/kg) significantly reduced infarct volume in MCAO/R mice from 42 % to 33 %, 27 %, and 20 %, and decreased neurological scores from 13 to 9, 7, and 5. Histology revealed alleviated hippocampal neuronal damage. In HT22 cells, ATL III decreased OGD/R-induced apoptosis, lowered ROS levels from 374 % to 202 %, increased SOD and GSH, and reduced MDA levels. Keap1 was identified as a direct target; ATL III disrupted the Keap1-Nrf2 interaction, reduced Keap1 protein levels, increased Nrf2 expression and nuclear translocation, and upregulated HO-1 expression. Nrf2 inhibition with ML385 abolished these antioxidative and neuroprotective effects in both models. CONCLUSION: ATL III protects against CIRI by directly targeting Keap1 and activating the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway. Given its favorable safety profile and blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability, ATL III holds promising translational potential as a plant-derived prophylactic agent for ischemic stroke.

Osteoarthritis (OA), the most prevalent degenerative joint disorder, remains a major clinical challenge due to its progressive nature and the lack of disease-modifying treatments. In this study, we identify Musashi2 (Msi2) deficiency in articular chondrocytes as a key contributor to OA pathogenesis. To evaluate the efficacy of ivcRNA-mediated protein replacement therapy, we developed a localized delivery strategy that enables high-yield and prolonged protein expression in chondrocytes. Using a destabilization of the medial meniscus (DMM) mouse model, we demonstrate that intra-articular delivery of ivcRNA encoding MSI2 effectively mitigates OA progression in male mice. Furthermore, therapeutic supplementation of SOX5, a downstream effector of MSI2, via ivcRNA delivery further validates this approach. Our findings establish ivcRNA-based protein replacement as a potential RNA therapeutic strategy for osteoarthritis.	Nature communications	2025 Sep 26
10.1038/s42255-025-01379-7	Cholesterol metabolic reprogramming mediates microglia-induced chronic	Zhao Q, Li J, Feng J, Wang X, Liu Y, Wang F, Liu L, Jin B, Lin M, Wang YC, Guo X, Chen J, Hao J	Chronic neuroinflammation is a major obstacle to post-stroke recovery, yet the underlying mechanisms, particularly the link between prolonged microglial activation and cholesterol metabolism, are not fully known. Here we show that ischaemic injury induces persistent microglial activation that perpetuates chronic inflammation, leading to microglial cholesterol accumulation and metabolic reprogramming. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we identified distinct stroke-associated foamy microglia clusters characterized by extensive reprogramming of cholesterol metabolism. Furthermore, direct intracerebral free cholesterol or cholesterol crystal infusion recapitulated sustained microglial activation, directly linking aberrant cholesterol metabolism to prolonged neuroinflammatory responses. Therapeutically, we demonstrate that reducing microglial cholesterol overload through genetic or pharmacological activation of CYP46A1 in male mice promotes white matter repair and functional recovery. These findings highlight microglial cholesterol metabolism as a key driver of post-stroke inflammation, offering therapeutic strategies targeting cholesterol metabolism to mitigate long-term brain damage and promote neurorestoration, potentially improving stroke-related disability outcomes.

10.1016/j.phymed.2025.157301	Integrating metagenomics, lipidomics and proteomics to explore the effect and	Zhao Y, Song T, Ren P, Wu X, Luo Q, Xie J, Lai H, Li X, Wen Y, Liao X, Zhou J	BACKGROUND: The comorbidity of atherosclerosis (AS) and depression presents a significant clinical challenge. Its pathogenesis entails complex abnormalities in inflammatory responses, lipid metabolism, and gut microbiota homeostasis. Ginsenoside Rb1 (GRb1)-a bioactive compound derived from the dried roots of Panax ginseng (Araliaceae)-demonstrates anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, lipid-lowering, and neuroprotective properties. However, GRb1's therapeutic potential and underlying mechanisms in AS co-depression remain inadequately characterized. PURPOSE: This study aims to elucidate the mechanism of GRb1 in AS co-depression disease, identify potential therapeutic targets, and thereby develop novel therapeutic strategies for this condition. METHODS: An AS co-depression comorbidity model was established using ApoE(⁻/⁻) mice fed a high-fat diet and subjected to chronic restraint stress. To evaluate GRb1's therapeutic efficacy, we assessed serum lipid profiles, performed aortic Oil Red O staining, and conducted behavioral tests for depressive-like phenotypes. Furthermore, we employed an integrated multi-omics approach-combining metagenomics, targeted lipid metabolomics, and proteomics-to identify key alterations in gut microbiota, lipid metabolites, and proteins, with subsequent correlation analysis. Key differential proteins and associated pathways identified through multi-omics were validated using both in vivo (AS co-depression mouse model) and in vitro (HT22 cells) experiments. Finally, GRb1's effects on ferroptosis and specific signaling pathways (CD44/Gls2, ACSL4/LPCAT3/ALOX15, SLC7A11/GPX4) were examined via Western blotting, immunofluorescence, and transmission electron microscopy in both mouse tissues and HT22 cells. RESULTS: Proteobacteria, Helicobacter, and Helicobacter_typhlonius represent significant intestinal microbiota components. Their primary differential lipids include phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidylcholine (PC), and lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC), while key differential proteins encompass CD44, Gls2, and Snrpf. Notably, a strong correlation exists among Helicobacter_typhlonius, PE, and CD44. GRb1 modulates PE metabolic dysregulation by reducing the relative abundance of Helicobacter_typhlonius, thereby inhibiting lipid peroxidation and ameliorating oxidative stress. Furthermore, GRb1 suppresses the CD44/Gls2 axis, ACSL4/LPCAT3/ALOX15 pathway, and activates the SLC7A11/GPX4-mediated ferroptosis pathway, thereby exerting its anti-AS co-depression effects through these multi-target mechanisms. CONCLUSION: GRb1 regulates the intestinal microbiota, abnormal lipid metabolism, modulates protein function, inhibits lipid peroxidation, improves oxidative stress, inhibits ferroptosis, regulates the CD44/Gls2, ACSL4/LPCAT3/ALOX15, SLC7A11/ GPX4 signaling pathways, and prevents the progression of AS co-depression disease.

The safety and efficacy profiles of available RSV vaccines, a critical consideration for their integration into public health strategies and clinical practice, remain uncertain. OBJECTIVES: To assess the benefits and harms of RSV vaccines compared to placebo, no intervention, vaccines for other respiratory infections, other RSV vaccines, or monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) across all human populations. SEARCH METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive literature search of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the WHO ICTRP following standard systematic review methodology from 2000 to April 2024. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: We included both randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and non-randomised studies of interventions (NRSIs) involving all human populations comparing RSV vaccines with placebo, no intervention, vaccines for other respiratory infections, other RSV vaccines, or mAbs. We excluded studies focused on dose-finding schedules and immunogenicity assessment. OUTCOMES: Benefits included frequency of RSV illness (both lower and upper respiratory illness) confirmed by laboratory tests (RSV-associated lower respiratory tract illness and RSV-associated acute respiratory illness); hospitalisation due to RSV disease (both lower and upper respiratory illness) confirmed by laboratory tests; mortality from illness caused by RSV (confirmed by laboratory test); all-cause mortality; and admission to an intensive care unit. Harms included serious adverse events (SAEs) related to vaccination, including neurological disorders such as Guillain-Barré syndrome. RISK OF BIAS: We assessed risk of bias in RCTs using Cochrane's RoB 2 tool. SYNTHESIS METHODS: We used standard Cochrane methods. INCLUDED STUDIES: We identified 14 RCTs: five trials (101,825 participants) on older adults; three trials (12,010 participants) on maternal vaccination and effects on infants; one trial (300 participants) on women of childbearing age; and five trials (192 participants) on infants and children. We identified no NRSIs. SYNTHESIS OF RESULTS: RSV prefusion vaccine versus placebo in older adults These vaccines reduced RSV-associated lower respiratory tract illness with vaccine efficacy (VE) of 77% (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.70 to 0.83; risk ratio (RR) 0.23, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.30; 4 RCTs, 99,931 participants; high-certainty evidence) and	The Cochrane database of systematic reviews	2025 Sep 29

In 2018, the WHO launched a strategy to eliminate cervical cancer, emphasizing the need for precise epidemiological assessments. OBJECTIVES: This study utilized Global Burden of Disease (GBD) data to analyze the epidemiological indicators, geographical patterns, and temporal trends of cervical cancer, evaluating the global impact of the WHO's strategy. METHODS: Data on cervical cancer from 204 countries and territories (from 1990 to 2021) were retrieved from the GBD database. The year 2018, marking the WHO's global call for elimination, was used to divide data into two periods: 1990 to 2018 and 2019 to 2021. Trends in age-standardized incidence rates and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) were assessed using estimated annual percentage changes (EAPCs) and joinpoint regression. The socio-demographic index (SDI) was regressed against epidemiological indicators to explore disparities. Health inequality analyses recommended by the WHO were conducted, and an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model was applied to predict future trends. RESULTS: From 1990 to 2021, global age-standardized incidence rates and DALYs declined. During 1990 to 2018, the highest EAPC values were observed in Southern Sub-Saharan Africa (2·18), East Asia (0·69), and Eastern Europe (0·31). After 2019, a more significant improvement was noted globally. Regression analyses revealed an	Journal of advanced research	2025 Sep 25

We sought to investigate the oncogenic role of poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase (PARG) and test potential therapeutic strategies. METHODS: A tissue microarray comprising 275 CCA patient samples was analyzed by immunohistochemistry. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry was utilized to identify downstream targets of PARG. Transgenic mice (Parg(f/f)) were employed to establish spontaneous CCA model via hydrodynamic tail vein injection (HTVi) and biliary instillation (BI). The efficacy of PARG inhibition was tested in various CCA preclinical models, including patient derived organoids (PDOs), patient-derived xenograft (PDX), an immunocompetent syngeneic murine model, and orthotopic xenograft models. Cytometry by time of flight (CyTOF) analysis was utilized to profile the changes in tumor microenvironment following PARG inhibition and anti-PD-1 therapy. RESULTS: PARG is highly expressed in CCA and predicts a dismal prognosis based on analysis of a large patient cohort. Genetic depletion of Parg in spontaneous CCA models induced by two methods, including HTVi and BI, significantly halted carcinogenesis. PARG inhibition alone showed impressive efficacy and potentiated Gem/Cis in PDOs, PDX, and orthotopic models. Mechanistically, PARG dePARylates and suppresses ITCH autoubiquitination, thus inhibiting the Hippo pathway, which promotes CCA proliferation and chemoresistance. Moreover, CyTOF analysis revealed the crosstalk between the tumor and stroma, which could be suppressed by PARG inhibitors via TEADs/CXCR4/CXCL12 axis. Combining PD-1 blockade and Gem/Cis with PARG inhibitors resulted in a significantly greater reduction in tumor burden, as well as a survival benefit. CONCLUSIONS: Targeting PARG limits CCA progression, alleviates desmoplasia, and enhances response to both anti-PD-1 therapy and chemotherapy. LAY SUMMARY: Little is known about the role of PARG in CCA development and progression. Herein, we show that PARG expression is upregulated and hyperactivated in CCA, promoting tumor cell proliferation, cancer-associated fibroblast recruitment, and resistance to therapy. Pharmacological inhibition of PARG suppresses CCA development and could be an effective therapeutic strategy when combined with chemotherapy and immunotherapy.	Journal of hepatology	2025 Sep 26

Targeting ferroptosis emerges as a promising strategy to enhance immunotherapy efficacy, prompting our investigation of antiplatelet agents that simultaneously promote ferroptosis and mitigate thromboembolic risks. Through systematic screening of 20 Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved antiplatelet agents, we identify vorapaxar as a potent pro-ferroptotic drug. Mechanistically, vorapaxar binds forkhead box O1 (FOXO1), inhibits its phosphorylation at Ser256, and facilitates nuclear translocation to upregulate heme oxygenase 1 (HMOX1), promoting mitochondrial iron overload and mitochondria-associated ferroptosis. Vorapaxar enhances immunotherapy-induced tumor ferroptosis and antitumor immunity across diverse melanoma models, including B16F10 tumor-bearing mice, Braf/Pten-driven spontaneous melanoma mice, and peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC)-humanized mice. Clinically, high FOXO1/HMOX1 co-expression correlates with improved immunotherapy response and progression-free survival. These findings position vorapaxar as a promising adjunct to immunotherapy, offering a dual benefit for cancer patients requiring both antithrombotic therapy and immunotherapy.	Cell reports.

Here, we investigate the link between unresolved parenchymal inflammation and cellular senescence in MS progression. Single-cell transcriptomic analysis of human brain tissue reveals an accumulation of senescent-like glial cells in diseased white matter, especially in chronic active lesions, and to a lesser extent in the cortex. Spatial transcriptomics show gradients of senescence-like signatures extending from lesion cores to periplaque regions, alongside rewired cellular networks. Experimental induction of senescence in MS hiPSC-derived neural organoids demonstrates that microglia are especially vulnerable to inflammation-induced senescence, which can be partially rescued by CNS-penetrant anti-inflammatory drugs. At the patient level (n = 466), increased 3T MRI-estimated brain-age is observed, especially in individuals with more than four chronic active lesions. These findings suggest that chronic inflammation might accelerate senescence-like processes, potentially contributing to disease progression, and that its modulation might help limit further propagation.

Their dysfunction is linked to hereditary ciliopathies with a wide phenotypic spectrum. Despite their significance, the specific roles of cilia in different cell types remain poorly understood due to limitations in analyzing ciliary protein composition. We employed antibody-based spatial proteomics to expand the Human Protein Atlas to primary cilia. Our analysis identified the subciliary locations of 715 proteins across three cell lines, examining 128,156 individual cilia. We found that 69% of the ciliary proteome is cell-type specific, and 78% exhibited single-cilia heterogeneity. Our findings portray cilia as sensors tuning their proteome to effectively sense the environment and compute cellular responses. We reveal 91 cilia proteins and found a genetic candidate variant in CREB3 in one clinical case with features overlapping ciliopathy phenotypes. This open, spatial cilia atlas advances research on cilia and ciliopathies.	Cell	2025 Sep 25

Patients received 2 cycles of neoadjuvant chemo-NIVO therapy (docetaxel + cisplatin + NIVO) and CCRT (total dose 54-64 Gy). Post-CCRT, eligible patients were randomized 1:1 to receive consolidative NIVO (360 mg every 3 weeks for up to 12 months) or observation. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) from randomization. Between December 3rd, 2019, and August 18th, 2023, 264 patients were enrolled, and 172 were randomized to NIVO consolidation (n = 86) or observation (n = 86). With a median follow-up of 22·8 months, NIVO consolidation resulted in significantly longer PFS than did observation (median not reached vs. 12.2 months [95% CI 10.2-20.8]; stratified hazard ratio 0·49 [95% CI 0.30-0.79], p = 0.003). NIVO consolidation also demonstrated superior PFS compared with a parallel real-world study, where patients received CCRT followed by consolidative immunotherapy (median PFS: 15.7 months [95% CI 11.9-NA]). Grade 3 or 4 toxicities occurred in 9.3% of patients in the consolidation group versus 4·6% in the observation group, with similar rates of pneumonitis (2.3% each) and proximal bronchial tree toxicity (3.5% vs. 2.3%). Treatment-related death occurred in 1 (1.2%) patient in the consolidation group because of pneumonitis. Patients with a high TMB had a longer PFS with consolidation (NR vs. 15.2 months, p = 0.042). Consolidative NIVO following neoadjuvant NIVO plus chemotherapy and CCRT demonstrated effectiveness and tolerability for patients with unresectable stage III NSCLC (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04085250).

10.1016/j.canlet.2025.218037	Oncoprotein SND1-enriched exosomes facilitate melanoma lung metastasis by	Chen Y, Wang X, Li H, Zhang Z, Gao Y, Ge L, Xin L, Gao X, Shi L, Hao J, Yao Z, Chen J, Yang X, Yang J	Staphylococcal nuclease and Tudor domain containing 1 (SND1) is an emerging oncoprotein highly expressed in various tumors. Database analyses indicate that SND1 is enriched in tumor-derived exosomes, suggesting its potential role in modulating the tumor microenvironment (TME) via exosomes. Here, we demonstrate that SND1 serves as a novel TEXs marker, influencing macrophage polarization by enriching exosomal membrane proteins. In mice, SND1 enriched in melanoma-derived exosomes promoted lung metastasis, accompanied by increased tumor-associated macrophage (TAM) infiltration. Conversely, SND1-deficient exosomes (Exo(SND1-KO)) shifted macrophage polarization toward an M1 phenotype, creating an anti-tumor immune microenvironment and inhibiting melanoma lung metastasis. Mechanistically, SND1 promotes ESCRT-dependent CD47 sorting, thereby facilitating its incorporation into melanoma-derived exosomes and allowing them to evade macrophage-mediated phagocytosis through the CD47-SIRPα axis. Consequently, macrophages fail to engulf TEXs or tumor cells. Notably, Exo(SND1-KO), lacking CD47, was preferentially phagocytosed by macrophages, triggering M1 reprogramming via exosome-derived dsDNA activation of the cGAS-STING/TBK1/NF-κB pathway. This process led to increased secretion of inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α) and activation of type I cell-mediated immunity. Our study suggests that targeting SND1 enrichment in tumor cells could be a promising strategy to inhibit tumor metastasis.	Cancer letters	2025 Sep 25
10.1016/j.mam.2025.101413	The double-edged sword: How SARS-CoV-2 might fuel lung cancer: Investigating the	Shen W, Guo Y, Ai C, Wang X, Li G	The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by SARS-CoV-2, has had far-reaching consequences beyond acute respiratory illness, with growing evidence suggesting potential long-term oncogenic effects. Lung cancer, a leading cause of cancer-related mortality, may intersect with COVID-19 through shared molecular pathways and altered disease dynamics. SARS-CoV-2 can exacerbate outcomes in existing cancer patients and potentially contribute to de novo lung carcinogenesis or accelerate progression via chronic inflammation, oxidative stress, immune dysregulation, cellular senescence, cell cycle disruption, metabolic reprogramming, and autophagy impairment. It has been proven that although the SARS virus is not capable of integrating into the host genome, it uses the mechanisms of other human oncoviruses to cause lung cancer. Post-COVID-19 pulmonary fibrosis, observed in up to one-third of severe cases, may act as a tumor precursor bridge through sustained tissue remodeling, extracellular matrix stiffness, and hypoxia-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Epidemiological studies indicate increased cancer-related mortality, metastatic reactivation of dormant cancer cells, and diagnostic delays, shifting presentations toward advanced stages during the pandemic. Synergistic risk factors, including smoking, air pollution, occupational exposures, and genetic predispositions, may further amplify oncogenic potential. The convergence of viral, environmental, and host factors creates a critical need for vigilant surveillance, biomarker development, and preventive strategies. This study aims to synthesize current epidemiological evidence, elucidate the molecular and cellular mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 may influence lung carcinogenesis, and highlight clinical implications to guide future research, screening, and therapeutic interventions.

To shed light on the molecular pathogenetic processes underlying the exordium and contribution of gliosis to disease onset and progression, we used cells, mice, and patient-derived cells modeling TDP-43, SOD1, and C9orf72-linked and sporadic ALS. Our data reveal a sequential disease progression, starting with enhanced glial reactivity and proliferation, and transitioning into inflammation with upregulation of pro-inflammatory genes. Using mouse genetics, we show that expression of mutant TDP-43 in astrocytes is necessary to cause gliosis and behavioral abnormalities. Mechanistically, we show that glial MYC gain-of-function drives neurodegeneration by promoting the release of astrocyte-derived EVs that nonetheless fail to provide trophic support to surrounding neurons. Our research reveals a novel functional role for MYC in glia-to-neuron miscommunication in ALS.	Brain : a journal of neurology	2025 Sep 26
10.1038/s41564-025-02126-0	Epstein-Barr virus exploits desmocollin 2 as the principal epithelial cell entry	Wang H, Mou Z, Yeo YY, Ge Q, Liu X, Narita Y, Li Z, Wang C, Li W, Zhao KR, Li J, Bu W, Gewurz B, Cohen JI, Teng M, Dai X, Liu X, Jiang S, Zhao B	Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infects B and epithelial cells, causing various lymphomas and epithelial malignancies. Although cell-free infection of epithelial cells is inefficient, direct B-epithelial cell contact infection is highly efficient and probably the dominant route. To identify mechanisms of contact-mediated infection, we implemented a genome-wide CRISPR screen and uncovered desmocollin 2 (DSC2) as an EBV epithelial receptor and DSC3 as a co-factor for infection. DSC2 and DSC3 double knockout significantly inhibited both cell-free and cell-cell contact EBV infection of normal oral keratinocytes, while their overexpression permitted infection in receptor-negative cells. Antibodies to DSC2 blocked infection across normal oral keratinocytes, primary oral keratinocytes, and head and neck epithelial organoids. Combining DSC2 and DSC3 antibodies efficiently blocked cell-cell contact infection. Mechanistically, DSC2 interacted with the EBV gH/gL glycoprotein and facilitated epithelial fusion. Notably, EphA2 overexpression failed to restore infection in DSC2/3-deficient cells, indicating its dependence on DSC2/3. Our findings establish DSC2 as a principal EBV entry receptor and target for vaccine and therapeutic development.	Nature microbiology	2025 Sep 26
10.3390/jcdd12090363	Association of Pan-Immune-Inflammation Value with All-Cause and Cardiovascular	Liu Q, Yang W, Zhang R, Guo X, Wei Y	BACKGROUND: Inflammatory responses critically impact long-term outcomes in myocardial infarction (MI) survivors, yet few biomarkers comprehensively evaluate systemic immune-inflammatory status. This study assessed the prognostic utility of a novel marker-the pan-immune-inflammation value (PIV)-for predicting all-cause and cardiovascular mortality post-MI. METHODS: Using the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data (2001-2018), 1559 MI survivors were included. PIV was calculated as (neutrophils × platelets × monocytes)/lymphocytes. Weighted Cox models assessed the association between log-transformed PIV (LnPIV) and mortality. Restricted cubic spline (RCS) models explored non-linear dose-response relationships, and predictive performance was evaluated via time-dependent ROC analysis. RESULTS: Over a median 75-month follow-up, 675 deaths occurred. LnPIV showed significant non-linear associations with all-cause (p < 0.0001) and cardiovascular mortality (p = 0.0471). When LnPIV ≥ 5.59, each unit increase was associated with an 85% (HR = 1.85, 95% CI: 1.49-2.28) higher all-cause mortality risk; for cardiovascular mortality, the risk increased by 77% (HR = 1.77, 95% CI: 1.20-2.63) when LnPIV ≥ 5.68. Time-dependent ROC analysis confirmed strong prediction above these thresholds. CONCLUSION: PIV demonstrates threshold-dependent mortality risk stratification in MI patients, particularly effective in high-inflammatory subgroups, offering a potential tool for personalized risk stratification.

10.1016/j.chom.2025.09.010	A Bacteroides fragilis protease activates host PAR(2) to induce intestinal pain	Lakemeyer M, Latorre R, Blazkova K, Wood HM, Jensen DD, Shakil N, Thomas SC, Saxena D, Mulpuri Y, Poolman D, Duran P, Keller LJ, Reed DE, Schmidt BL, Jiménez-Vargas NN, Xu F, Lomax AE, Bunnett NW, Bogyo M	Protease-activated receptor 2 (PAR(2)) is a central regulator of intestinal barrier function, inflammation, and pain. Upregulated intestinal proteolysis and PAR(2) signaling are implicated in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), conditions often associated with gut microbiome alterations. To identify potential bacterial regulators of PAR(2) activity, we developed a functional assay for PAR(2) processing to screen a library of diverse gut microbes. We identify multiple bacteria that secrete proteases capable of cleaving host PAR(2). Using chemoproteomic profiling with a covalent irreversible inhibitor, we uncovered a previously uncharacterized Bacteroides fragilis serine protease 1 (Bfp1) and show that it cleaves and activates PAR(2) in multicellular and murine models. PAR(2) cleavage by Bfp1 disrupts the intestinal barrier, sensitizes nociceptors, and triggers colonic inflammation and abdominal pain. Collectively, our findings uncover Bfp1-mediated PAR(2) processing as an axis of host-commensal interaction in the gut that has the potential to be targeted for therapeutic intervention in IBD or IBS.

Lysine-specific demethylase 1 (Lsd1) plays a key role in colonic inflammation and tumorigenesis. Here, we developed an oral genome-editing platform (TPGS-RNP@LNP), where Lsd1-targeting ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) were encapsulated in mulberry leaf lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) and formulated with d-α-tocopherol polyethylene glycol succinate (TPGS). TPGS reinforced the lipid bilayer of LNPs, enhanced gastrointestinal stability, and facilitated colonic mucus penetration. Upon the galactose receptor-mediated endocytosis of TPGS-RNP@LNPs by macrophages, their fusion with the endosomal membrane and the presence of nuclear localization signals ensured the nuclear delivery of RNPs. TPGS-RNP@LNPs achieved 59.7% Lsd1 editing efficiency in macrophages, surpassing the commercial CRISPRMAX (43.0%). Oral TPGS-RNP@LNPs promoted H3K4 methylation to modulate epigenetic states, achieving inflammation mitigation, epithelial barrier restoration, and retardation of colitis and its associated tumorigenesis. As an LNP-based oral RNP delivery system, TPGS-RNP@LNPs provide a promising platform for precise treatment of colorectal diseases.	Science advances	2025 Sep 26
10.1186/s13020-025-01189-9	Salvianolic acid B and Senkyunolide I synergistically alleviate cardiac	Liu C, Guo R, Zhou Y, Zhu M, Shao L, Wang Y, Zhao L	BACKGROUND: Cardiac hypertrophy, characterized by the thickening of the heart muscle, arises from factors such as hypertension and genetic mutations, often leading to adverse outcomes like heart failure and arrhythmias. Guanxinning tablets (GXNT), a botanical drug composed of the blood-activating herbs Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge. and Ligusticum striatum DC., are widely used in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. However, the active ingredients and their molecular mechanisms are yet to be fully understood. METHODS: We evaluated the anti-hypertrophic effects of GXNT and screened its active substances via cardiac function live-imaging on an aristolochic acid A-stimulated zebrafish cardiac hypertrophy model, and through F-actin immunostaining on a phenylephrine-induced hypertrophic NRCMs model. Additionally, the protective effects of GXNT's active substances were analyzed in a mouse model of cardiac hypertrophy using echocardiography, histopathology analysis, and western blotting. RESULTS: The anti-hypertrophic effects of GXNT were assessed using an aristolochic acid A-stimulated zebrafish model and phenylephrine-induced hypertrophic NRCMs. GXNT demonstrated significant anti-hypertrophic effects in both models. Phenotypic screening identified Senkyunolide I (Sen I) from Ligusticum striatum as the active component in the zebrafish model, while Salvianolic acid B (Sal B) and Rosmarinic acid from Salvia miltiorrhiza emerged as the key anti-hypertrophic compound in NRCMs. In a mouse model of isoproterenol-induced cardiac hypertrophy, Sal B and Sen I showed synergistic effects, improving cardiac function, reducing oxidative stress, and suppressing inflammation. Mechanistically, transcriptomic sequencing highlighted cooperative modulation of MAP3K1 signaling by the two compounds. Notably, siRNA-mediated knockdown of MAP3K1 in cardiomyocytes attenuated the hypertrophic phenotype, supporting its essential role in the pathological process. Molecular docking and dynamic simulations further supported their binding potential to MAP3K1. CONCLUSION: These findings underscore GXNT's potent anti-hypertrophic effects, possibly driven by the synergistic actions of Sal B and Sen I, and offer insights into its therapeutic potential through MAP3K1 signaling regulation.

10.1007/s00280-025-04822-4	Non-oncologic to oncologic drug: A systematic review of drug repurposing in	Dhanush Y, Ganesh VS	PURPOSE: This systematic review investigates drug repurposing as a strategy to accelerate and improve cancer treatment by specifically examining how existing medications can effectively target the established hallmarks of cancer. The research explores how repurposed drugs can address the challenges of conventional cancer drug development, including high costs, lengthy development timelines, and frequent clinical failures. METHODS: The review systematically analyzes repurposed drugs with their ability to target specific cancer hallmarks, including oncogenic signaling pathways, cell death regulation, metabolic reprogramming, growth suppressor reactivation, phenotypic plasticity, antitumor immunity, telomerase activity, angiogenesis, inflammation, cellular senescence, invasion and metastasis, DNA damage response, microbiome modulation, and epigenetic regulation. RESULTS: The analysis identified several promising repurposed medications targeting specific cancer hallmarks: artemisinin derivatives for oncogenic signalling, niclosamide for cell death pathways, leflunomide for metabolic dysregulation, statins for tumour suppressor reactivation, metformin for phenotypic plasticity, liothyronine for immune activation, PARP inhibitors for replication, itraconazole for angiogenesis, celecoxib for inflammation, BCL-2 inhibitors for senescence, fluoroquinolones for metastasis, spironolactone for DNA damage, isoliquiritigenin for microbiome modulation, and various agents targeting non-mutational epigenetic regulation. CONCLUSION: Drug repurposing represents an intriguing approach for addressing the limitations of traditional cancer drug development while effectively targeting the fundamental hallmarks of cancer. By leveraging existing medications with established safety profiles, this strategy offers potential for more rapid translation to clinical applications and may enhance the therapeutic arsenal against various cancer types.

10.1016/S1474-4422(25)00249-2	Blood and CSF biomarkers for multiple sclerosis: emerging clinical applications.	Chitnis T, Magliozzi R, Abdelhak A, Kuhle J, Leppert D, Bielekova B	Neurofilament light chain (NfL), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), chitinase-3-like protein 1 (CHI3L1), and other protein assays are being developed as diagnostic or prognostic biomarkers in multiple sclerosis. An increase in NfL concentrations reflects axonal damage resulting from the acute new inflammatory disease activity that occurs during a relapse. NfL concentrations can also reflect the occurrence of new MRI lesions. GFAP concentrations are increased in people with progressive forms of multiple sclerosis, and GFAP is an emerging biomarker of progression independent of relapses. CHI3L1 is an emerging biomarker associated with progression independent of relapse activity and several MRI lesion types, including paramagnetic rim lesions. Some biomarkers, particularly NfL, can help monitoring treatment response, and combinations of multivariate biomarkers provide additional accuracy in specific clinical scenarios. In multiple sclerosis, fluid-based biomarkers are quickly emerging as instruments for clinical monitoring of disease course and patients' response to treatment.	The Lancet. Neurology	2025 Sep 24

Gillmore JD, Gane E, Täubel J, Pilebro B, Echaniz-Laguna A, Kao J, Litchy W, Shahda S, Haagensen A, Walsh L, Smith D, Kachadourian J, Ward JH, Lebwohl D, Zhu P, Xu Y, Leung A, Sonderfan A, Gutstein DE, Manvelian G, Adams D	BACKGROUND: Hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis with polyneuropathy (ATTRv-PN) is a rare, multisystem, progressive, debilitating, and fatal disease characterized by tissue deposition of misfolded transthyretin (TTR) in peripheral nerves. Nexiguran ziclumeran (nex-z) is an investigational in vivo therapy based on CRISPR-Cas9 (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats and associated Cas9 endonuclease) that is designed to reduce serum TTR levels through selective inactivation of TTR in the liver. METHODS: In this phase 1, open-label study, we administered one infusion of nex-z to patients with ATTRv-PN. Primary objectives included assessment of the safety and pharmacodynamics of nex-z. Secondary end points included changes in the familial amyloid polyneuropathy stage, polyneuropathy disability score, serum neurofilament light chain (NfL) level, modified body-mass index (modified BMI, defined as the conventional BMI [weight in kilograms divided by square of height in meters] multiplied by the albumin level in grams per liter), and modified Neuropathy Impairment Score+7 (mNIS+7; range, 0 to 304, with higher scores indicating more impairment). RESULTS: A total of 36 patients received nex-z; the mean follow-up was 27 months. The mean percent change from baseline in the serum TTR level was -90% at day 28, which was sustained through month 24 (-92%). Treatment-related adverse events included transient infusion-related reactions (in 21 patients), decreased thyroxine level without hypothyroidism or elevated thyrotropin level (in 8), and headache (in 4). One participant died from cardiac amyloidosis, and one withdrew owing to progressive decline in motor function. Serious adverse events were reported in 11 patients. At month 24, the familial amyloid polyneuropathy stage and polyneuropathy disability score remained stable in 29 and 27 patients, respectively; improved in 2 and 5, respectively; and worsened in 2 and 2, respectively. The mean change in the serum NfL level was -9.0 pg per milliliter, and the change in the modified BMI was 24.7. The mean change from baseline in the mNIS+7 was -8.5. CONCLUSIONS: A single administration of nex-z in patients with ATTRv-PN was associated with rapid, deep, and durable reductions in serum TTR levels. The results support further investigation of nex-z to treat ATTRv-PN. (Funded by Intellia Therapeutics and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT04601051.).

10.1007/s12032-025-03067-8	Engineering adoptive cell therapy for solid tumors.	Sanjary M, Shokati A, Rahnama MA, Khaseb S, Ahmadvand M	Adaptive cell therapy (ACT) has emerged as a promising immunotherapeutic approach for cancer treatment by using engineered immune cells to recognize and destroy malignant cells. While ACT has shown remarkable success in hematologic malignancies, its application in solid tumors remains limited due to unique challenges such as limited immune cell infiltration, antigen heterogeneity, and the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. This review provides an overview of current strategies to enhance the efficacy of ACT in solid tumors, focusing on engineered T cells, including CAR-T, TCR-T, and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). We discuss recent progress in cancer immunotherapy, with a focus on tumor targeting, resistance to immunosuppressive signals, as well as strategies to overcome antigen escape. Moreover, we highlight the role of gene-editing tools such as CRISPR/Cas9 in designing next-generation immune cells with enhanced functionality and safety. By integrating novel engineering techniques and systems biology approaches, ACT holds the potential to become a key component of personalized cancer therapy for solid tumors.

10.1152/advan.00039.2021	Effect of self-regulated learning and technology-enhanced activities on anatomy	Bains M, Kaliski DZ, Goei KA	Problem-based learning (PBL) offers advantages for teaching anatomy and physiology for physical therapy students as clinical cases provide a scaffold for a comprehensive review of body systems. Although the utilization of interactive anatomy software greatly contributes to an active learning environment and efficient use of time, simply providing textbook readings, access to anatomy software, and models is not enough to engage students to become active in reaching their learning goals. Time constraints, meaningful technology implementation, resource abundance, and unfamiliarity are challenges that decrease the effectiveness of both facilitating and learning anatomy. The present study investigated the use of three supplemental learning tools to support anatomy instruction in a self-regulated manner. Friedman test results demonstrated significant differences for perceived engagement [χ(2)(2) = 15.74, P < 0.001, W = 0.23] but not for perceived learning. Survey responses demonstrated that perceived engagement was greatest with the nondigital supplemental learning tool compared with the two technology-enhanced learning tools (iBooks Author + SoftChalk and SoftChalk alone). Multivariate regression analyses demonstrated statistically significant relationships between the nondigital supplemental learning tool and anatomy practical scores (P < 0.001). The technology-enhanced supplemental learning tools did not further increase learning outcomes as measured by practical scores compared with nondigital learning tools. Incorporation of instructor-created instructional materials independent of technology is an efficient method to drive self-regulated learning, enhance engagement, and improve anatomy course outcomes and may overcome barriers associated with a purely self-directed PBL model.

To define the DA tumor microenvironment (TME), we performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) on primary DA tumors and matched adjacent normal tissues. This analysis revealed substantial heterogeneity among malignant epithelial cells, including a transcriptionally distinct subset characterized by the upregulation of immune-related genes, which constitutes an immune-associated transcriptional program. Notably, this program included high expression of the chemokine CCL5, which facilitated the recruitment of CCR1(+) macrophages. Using patient-derived DA organoids, we identified malignant cells exhibiting immune-related transcriptional signatures, including elevated CCL5. Functional assays demonstrated that CCL5 promoted CCR1(+) macrophage migration, an effect suppressed by both the CCR1 antagonist BX471 and CCL5-neutralizing antibody. In co-culture, CCL5-expressing DA organoids displayed enhanced survival and proliferation in the presence of CCR1(+) macrophages, while pharmacological blockade of CCR1 significantly increased tumor cell death. Bulk transcriptomic profiling revealed that CCR1 downregulates pro-apoptotic signaling in tumor cells, thereby promoting cell survival and growth. Importantly, combining CCL5/CCR1 inhibitors with standard chemotherapeutic agents resulted in synergistic tumor cell killing. Together, our findings establish the CCL5/CCR1 axis as a key mediator of tumor-macrophage crosstalk in DA, supporting immune evasion and chemoresistance via suppression of macrophage-induced apoptosis. Targeting this axis may represent a promising therapeutic strategy to enhance the efficacy of conventional chemotherapy in DA.	Cancer letters	2025 Sep 25
10.1016/j.beem.2025.102038	Preconception use of GLP-1 and GLP-1/GIP receptor agonists for obesity treatment.	Koceva A, Janež A, Jensterle M	Obesity is rising among women of reproductive age and significantly contributes to subfertility. If conception occurs, maternal obesity is associated with increased risks for both maternal and neonatal complications, with potential long-term effects on the offspring's health. Current clinical guidelines emphasize the importance of preconception weight optimization in women with obesity to reduce maternal and fetal risks. Amid the rising use of incretin-based anti-obesity medications, particularly among young women, their potential role in preconception care is receiving growing clinical and research interest. With unplanned pregnancies remaining common, incidental exposure during early pregnancy is becoming more likely. In parallel, there is increasing interest in the potential of these agents to support preconception weight loss and enhance fertility outcomes in women with obesity. This narrative review examines the current human evidence on GLP-1 and dual GLP-1/GIP receptor agonists approved for obesity treatment, focusing on their potential role in preconception care and addressing key safety considerations and challenges related to their use during the preconception period, as well as inadvertent exposure in early pregnancy.

10.1016/j.lanhl.2025.100763	Integrating exercise and medication management in geriatric care: a holistic	Izquierdo M, Ramírez-Vélez R, Fiatarone Singh MA	Integrating exercise prescriptions with medication management represents a novel approach for enhancing health and function, optimising medication effectiveness, and reducing adverse drug reactions and polypharmacy in older adults (ie, those aged ≥60 years). This Personal View highlights the need for a comprehensive assessment of lifestyle, diagnoses, geriatric syndromes, and medications with an emphasis on fully incorporating exercise treatment into geriatric care. Exercise is an alternative to less effective or unsafe medications for many conditions, including depression, anxiety, insomnia, osteoarthritis, and dementia. Exercise is an important adjunct to pharmacotherapy for many common chronic conditions such as coronary artery disease, heart failure, diabetes, osteoporosis, cancer, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Adding exercise to drug management can mitigate adverse drug reactions, enhance medication compliance, and reduce the adverse effects of sedentary behaviour and ageing processes on chronic disease expression. Targeted exercise programmes have also been shown to ameliorate drug-induced side-effects, including anorexia, falls, sarcopenia, osteoporosis, and orthostatic hypotension, and to overcome constraints such as reduced aerobic fitness, balance impairment, and muscle atrophy due to some medications. Health-care professionals require additional training and support to ensure that exercise assumes a key, central role in older adults with multimorbidity and polypharmacy, as supported by the current literature. This Personal View describes practical approaches to incorporating exercise into clinical practice as a step towards an integrated geriatric care model, with the ultimate aim of increasing health span and minimising disability.

10.1186/s12933-025-02921-3	Association of the triglyceride-glucose index combined with a body shape index	Chen M, Guo J, Shangguan Y, Sun Z, He X, Tu Q, Yan Q	BACKGROUND: The triglyceride-glucose (TyG) index, as a measure of insulin resistance, has been confirmed to be associated with adverse clinical outcomes. The new composite indicator, TyG-A body type index (TyG-ABSI), by integrating the TyG index and the A body type index, has demonstrated superior efficacy in predicting the risk of cardiovascular death in the general population compared to traditional indicators. This study aims to deeply explore the association between TyG-ABSI and all-cause mortality and CVD mortality in the population with cardiovascular kidney-metabolic syndrome (CKM) stages 0-3. The analysis will be conducted from multiple dimensions such as the intensity of indicator correlation and potential influencing mechanisms, in order to comprehensively reveal the relationship between the two. RESULTS: We analyzed data from 13,480 participants in the NHANES cohort (1999-2018) using Cox proportional hazards models and restricted cubic spline functions. The results indicated that elevated TyG-ABSI values were independently associated with a higher risk of all-cause mortality (HR = 1.226, 95% CI 1.104-1.361) and cardiovascular mortality (HR = 1.377, 95% CI 1.149-1.651). Time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and concordance index evaluations demonstrated that TyG-ABSI yielded more accurate long-term prognostic performance than other TyG-derived metrics. The area under the curve (AUC) of this indicator reached 0.688-0.708 in the prediction of all-cause mortality risk over 5-15 years, and 0.696-0.739 in the prediction of cardiovascular mortality risk. External validation using CHARLS data confirmed the robustness of these findings in predicting all-cause mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Among individuals with CKM stages 0-3, TyG-ABSI demonstrates a stronger association with mortality risk and superior predictive ability compared with other TyG-derived metrics.

The new 2024 McDonald criteria provide a unified approach for diagnosing multiple sclerosis in individuals with relapsing or progressive courses throughout the lifespan (ie, from paediatric to late-life presentations). The optic nerve can now serve as a fifth anatomical location within the CNS for diagnosis. The central vein sign, paramagnetic rim lesions, and kappa free-light chain concentrations in CSF can be used, when available, to provide supportive evidence and confer specificity for a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis in specific situations. In certain cases, radiologically isolated syndrome or neurological symptoms that do not constitute a clear attack or progression of disability can fulfil the criteria for a multiple sclerosis diagnosis. We also provide guidance for the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis in older individuals (≥50 years) and those with comorbidities. The 2024 revised criteria should expedite the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis, while maintaining specificity.	The Lancet. Neurology	2025 Oct
10.1186/s12984-025-01738-1	Effects of intermittent theta-burst stimulation on cognition and glymphatic	Yang CC, Huang KY, Hsu JL, Hu CJ, Lu YH, Kuan YC	BACKGROUND: Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has demonstrated efficacy in alleviating cognitive symptoms in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Although animal studies suggest rTMS may enhance glymphatic system efficiency and reduce amyloid deposits, its impact on human glymphatic activity remains uncertain. METHODS: This double-blind, randomized, sham-controlled trial investigated the effects of intermittent theta-burst stimulation (iTBS), a novel rTMS technique, on cognitive function and glymphatic system activity using diffusion tensor image analysis along the perivascular space (DTI-ALPS) in 52 participants with amnestic MCI or very mild AD. Participants underwent 10 sessions of iTBS targeting the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex over two weeks. Cognitive and glymphatic assessments were conducted at baseline, week 2, and week 6. Of the 52 participants, 28 received active iTBS, while 24 received sham stimulation. After the first two weeks, the sham group transitioned to active iTBS. RESULTS: Significant cognitive improvements were observed at week 6 in the iTBS group, indicating delayed cognitive enhancement, though no immediate changes in cognition or glymphatic system activity (measured by the ALPS index) were observed. No adverse events were reported. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that iTBS can produce delayed cognitive enhancement in individuals with amnestic MCI and very mild AD, while the impact on the glymphatic system remains uncertain and requires further investigation.

The gut microbiota and their metabolites are closely associated with kidney injury. However, the exact mechanisms underlying this link are unclear. Here, we find that renal IRI reduces ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), a metabolite of Eubacterium limosum (E. limosum), in mice cecal content and serum. Conversely, supplementation with either E. limosum or UDCA prevents these mice from IRI. Mechanistically, UDCA directly binds and activates peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARγ) to increase fatty acid oxidation, inducing ATP production and reducing lipid accumulation in proximal tubular epithelial cells, ultimately protecting the kidney against IRI. Importantly, while renal IRI in patients markedly lowers their serum UDCA, patients with higher pre-IRI UDCA or E. limosum level develop less severe IRI. Collectively, our findings highlight the rationale of using UDCA and E. limosum for the prevention or treatment of renal IRI.	Cell reports. Medicine	2025 Sep 26
10.3390/ijms21030969	Precision Psychiatry Applications with Pharmacogenomics: Artificial Intelligence	Lin E, Lin CH, Lane HY	A growing body of evidence now suggests that precision psychiatry, an interdisciplinary field of psychiatry, precision medicine, and pharmacogenomics, serves as an indispensable foundation of medical practices by offering the accurate medication with the accurate dose at the accurate time to patients with psychiatric disorders. In light of the latest advancements in artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques, numerous biomarkers and genetic loci associated with psychiatric diseases and relevant treatments are being discovered in precision psychiatry research by employing neuroimaging and multi-omics. In this review, we focus on the latest developments for precision psychiatry research using artificial intelligence and machine learning approaches, such as deep learning and neural network algorithms, together with multi-omics and neuroimaging data. Firstly, we review precision psychiatry and pharmacogenomics studies that leverage various artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques to assess treatment prediction, prognosis prediction, diagnosis prediction, and the detection of potential biomarkers. In addition, we describe potential biomarkers and genetic loci that have been discovered to be associated with psychiatric diseases and relevant treatments. Moreover, we outline the limitations in regard to the previous precision psychiatry and pharmacogenomics studies. Finally, we present a discussion of directions and challenges for future research.

10.1158/1940-6207.CAPR-09-0165	The detection of chromosomal aneusomy by fluorescence in situ hybridization in	Varella-Garcia M, Schulte AP, Wolf HJ, Feser WJ, Zeng C, Braudrick S, Yin X, Hirsch FR, Kennedy TC, Keith RL, Barón AE, Belinsky SA, Miller YE, Byers T, Franklin WA	Lung cancer usually is disseminated (advanced) and has a poor prognosis at diagnosis. Current and former smokers are at a high risk for lung cancer and are candidates for prevention and early detection strategies. Sputum is a potential source of biomarkers that might determine either lung cancer risk or the presence of early lung cancer, but no current sputum test is sufficiently sensitive and specific for effective screening. We used fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to measure chromosomal aneusomy (CA) in sputum samples collected prospectively from 100 incident lung cancer cases and 96 controls (matched on age, gender, and date of collection) nested within an ongoing high-risk cohort. The CA-FISH assay was aimed at four DNA targets: epidermal growth factor receptor, MYC, 5p15, and CEP 6. The sensitivity of a positive CA-FISH assay (abnormal for two or more of the four markers) for lung cancer was substantially higher for samples collected within 18 months (76% sensitivity) than for samples collected more than 18 months (31%) before lung cancer diagnosis. Sensitivity was higher for squamous cell cancers (94%) than for other histologic types (69%).	Cancer prevention research (Philadelphia, Pa.)	2010 Apr

The evolving epidemiology and complex pathophysiology of MetALD present unique challenges and opportunities for clinical trial design. Inclusion criteria should require simultaneous evidence of metabolic dysfunction (at least two cardiometabolic features) and verified quantifiable alcohol exposure recorded over the preceding 3-6 months. Traditional histological end points are limited by invasiveness, sampling error and interpretative variability. Thus, imaging modalities, serum-based fibrosis biomarkers and quantitative measures of alcohol intake are gaining relevance as non-invasive, reproducible and patient-centric end points aiming to improve trial feasibility. Furthermore, incorporating alcohol biomarkers, stratifying patients by metabolic risk factor burden, and using adaptive designs of trials might enhance the precision and generalizability of MetALD clinical trials. Although uncertainties remain regarding optimal patient selection criteria, event rates and the dynamic interplay between metabolic dysfunction and alcohol intake, ongoing research efforts aim to refine diagnostic criteria, standardize methodologies and validate novel end points. These advances will ultimately accelerate drug development, improve trial efficiency and foster interventions to treat MetALD.	Nature reviews. Gastroenterology & hepatology	2025 Sep 26
10.1007/s10495-025-02190-1	Integrating pathology genomics and single-cell genomics to identify lactate	Zhao S, Liang X, Xie J, Lin Z, Li Z, Jiang Z, Chen W, Dai H, He Y, Li L	Cutaneous melanoma (SKCM) is highly malignant and prone to developing treatment resistance. Lactate metabolism in the tumor microenvironment (TME) plays a crucial role in SKCM progression, immune evasion, and therapy resistance. This study aimed to integrate multi-omics data to systematically characterize the molecular features of lactate metabolism in SKCM, construct an effective prognostic model, and explore potential therapeutic strategies. Quantitative pathological features were extracted using CellProfiler and combined with deep learning features obtained from a pre-trained ResNet50 convolutional neural network. Gene set variation analysis (GSVA) was used to calculate lactate metabolism scores and identify associated pathological features. Single-cell RNA sequencing was applied to assess lactate metabolic activity across different cell types. These data, together with spatial transcriptomics, genomic alterations, immune infiltration profiles, and immunotherapy response data, were integrated to construct a lactate metabolism signature (LMS) prognostic model (comprising 3 pathological features and 11 genes). The model was developed using 101 combinations of 10 machine learning algorithms. Furthermore, RAB32 knockdown experiments were performed to verify its effects on melanoma cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and metabolism. A total of 443 pathological imaging features significantly associated with lactate metabolism were identified. Single-cell analysis revealed that melanoma cells exhibited the highest lactate metabolic activity, with markedly enhanced intercellular communication in the high-metabolism group. The LMS model demonstrated excellent prognostic performance in both the TCGA training and validation cohorts. Patients in the high-LMS group had significantly shorter survival, showed immune evasion features, and exhibited activation of melanoma-related metabolic and signaling pathways (e.g., oxidative phosphorylation). In contrast, the low-LMS group had stronger immune infiltration and higher expression of immune checkpoint molecules. The key gene RAB32 was significantly correlated with all lactate metabolism-related pathological features, was highly expressed in the tumor core, and its high expression predicted poor prognosis. RAB32 knockdown markedly inhibited melanoma cell proliferation, migration, and invasion; reduced lactate production; suppressed the expression of glycolytic enzymes and lactate transporters; and decreased extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) and oxygen consumption rate (OCR). In addition, it significantly inhibited tumor growth in mouse xenograft models. This study developed a multi-omics-integrated prognostic model (LMS) based on lactate metabolism, providing a novel tool for risk stratification and therapeutic decision-making in SKCM patients. It also identified RAB32 as a central player in tumor metabolic reprogramming and invasiveness, with promising potential as a therapeutic target.

Here we develop a NLPHL specific lymphocyte-predominant ecotype (LPE) model to identify 34 distinct cell states across 14 cell types that co-occur within 3 LPEs for 171 cases. LPE1 and LPE2 were characterized by immunosuppressive microenvironments with high expression of B2M on LP cells, CD8 T-cell exhaustion, immune checkpoint genes expressed by follicular T-cells, and an improved freedom from progression compared to LPE3 in training (n = 109, with 65% LPE1/2) and validation cohorts (n = 62, with 61% LPE1/2). We validate the co-occurrence and co-localization of cell states using spatial transcriptomics. Protein expression of HLA-I and HLA-II on LP cells and SSTR2 on dendritic cells was predictive of LPE1 (C-statistic=0.69), LPE2 (C-statistic=0.79), and LPE3 (C-statistic=0.60). This study establishes a clinically relevant biologic categorization for NLPHL.	Nature communications	2025 Sep 26
10.1186/s40001-025-03122-0	Association between asthma and thyroid function as well as thyroid hormone	Li K, Ding Q, Liu R, Lin S, Qiu R, Wu G	OBJECTIVE: Thyroid hormones significantly influence multiple physiological systems, particularly the respiratory system. Despite limited research on asthma-thyroid associations, emerging studies have begun exploring this link. This cross-sectional study investigates relationships between asthma, thyroid function, and thyroid hormone sensitivity in U.S. adults using NHANES data. METHODS: A total of 8160 participants were included in this study. Weighted analyses of data from the 2007-2012 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) were performed to examine the associations between asthma, thyroid function, and thyroid hormone sensitivity indices. Subgroup analyses and ROC curve investigations were also conducted. Additionally, a retrospective cohort of 30 asthma patients and 30 non-asthmatic controls seen at Zhongshan Hospital, Xiamen University between July 2023 and July 2025 was extracted; FT3 levels were compared and asthma control was evaluated across FT3 tertiles. Thyroid function parameters assessed were as follows: free triiodothyronine (FT3), free thyroxine (FT4), total triiodothyronine (TT3), total thyroxine (TT4), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), thyroid peroxidase antibody (TPOAb), thyroglobulin antibody (TgAb), and thyroglobulin (Tg). Thyroid hormone sensitivity indices-namely, the FT3/FT4 ratio, thyrotroph T4 resistance index (TT4RI), thyroid-stimulating hormone index (TSHI), and thyroid feedback quantile index (TFQI)-were calculated from serum FT3, FT4, and TSH values. RESULTS: Asthmatics exhibited higher FT3 and FT3/FT4 levels but lower TPOAb than non-asthmatics. However, adjusted models (2 and 3) revealed an inverse association between asthma risk and FT3/FT4 (β: - 0.05, 95% CI - 0.09 to - 0.01). Quartile stratification maintained this inverse trend, with significant dose-response relationships in unadjusted Model 1 (P < 0.05). Subgroup analyses showed Mexican American asthmatics had lower FT3 and FT3/FT4 levels. ROC curves indicated superior predictive accuracy for TPOAb (AUC = 0.60) compared to FT3/FT4. Our institutional validation revealed that asthma patients had significantly lower FT3 levels than controls, and higher FT3 was associated with a lower proportion of acute exacerbations; however, the trend did not reach statistical significance. CONCLUSION: FT3 and FT3/FT4 levels may inversely correlate with asthma risk, though causality remains unclear due to study design limitations. Further research is warranted.

10.1038/s41467-025-63338-w	CD137L promotes immune surveillance in melanoma via HLTF regulation.	Liang L, Zhu L, Li X, Zhou W, Zhang Y, Hung MC, Zhang G, Chen Y, Kuang X, Su J, Liu J, Chen X, Liu H	Immune checkpoint blockers (ICBs) have demonstrated substantial efficacy across various malignancies, yet the benefits of ICBs are limited to a subset of patients. Therefore, it is essential to identify novel therapeutic targets. By integrating multi-omics data from cohorts of patients with melanoma treated with ICBs, a positive correlation is observed between tumor CD137L expression and the efficacy of PD-1 blockade. Functionally, CD137L induction in cancer cells significantly enhances anti-tumor immunity by promoting CD8(+) T cell survival, both in vivo and in vitro. Mechanistically, helicase-like transcription factor (HLTF) is identified as a pivotal transcriptional regulator of CD137L, controlling its expression through phosphorylation of serine at position 398. Therapeutically, the AMPK agonist AICAR (acadesine) as an inducer of CD137L, exhibiting synergistic effects with PD-1 or CTLA-4 blockade. In summary, our findings elucidate a mechanism controlling CD137L expression and highlight a promising combination therapy to enhance the efficacy of ICBs in melanoma. One Sentence Summary: Inducing co-stimulatory immune checkpoint CD137L expression in melanoma cells enhances T cell-mediated anti-tumor immunity.	Nature communications	2025 Sep 26
10.1016/j.heares.2011.01.015	Roles of prostaglandin E2 in the cochlea.	Nakagawa T	Prostaglandins are one of the major groups of chemical mediators in the mammalian body. Among prostaglandins, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) is the most abundant prostanoid in humans and involved in regulating many different fundamental biological functions. PGE2 signaling is mediated by four distinct E-prostanoid receptors (EPs) namely EP1-4. Recently, accumulating evidence indicates critical, but complex roles of EP signaling in the pathogenesis of neuronal diseases depending on the context of neuronal injury. Four distinct EPs are expressed in the stria vascularis, spiral ligament, spiral ganglion and organ of Corti, indicating an involvement of EP signaling in the cochlear function. Activation of EP4 in cochleae significantly attenuates noise-induced damage in cochleae, and activation of EP2 or EP4 induces the formation of vascular endothelial growth factor in cochleae. These findings strongly suggest that individual EP signaling may be involved in the maintenance of the cochlear sensory system similarly to the central nervous system. This review highlights recent findings on EP signaling in the central nervous system, and presents its possible roles in regulation of blood flow, protection of sensory cells and immune responses in cochleae.

We examined the contribution of activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4), the central node of the integrated stress response (ISR), to T cell dysfunction in tumors. CD8(+) tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in patient samples exhibited chronic ATF4 activity, which was reflected across various tumor models. Hypoxia in the TME imposed chronic ATF4 activity via the ISR kinases. ATF4 overexpression in CD8(+) T cells induced metabolic polarity, mitochondrial oxidative stress, and cell death, impairing antitumor immunity. Chronic ATF4 transcriptional activity replicated the terminal exhaustion CD8(+) T cell state independent of T cell receptor (TCR) stimulation. Genetic or pharmacologic attenuation of ATF4 reduced mitochondrial oxidative stress and promoted CD8(+) TIL viability, enabling response to programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) inhibitor therapy and conferring protection from re-emergent disease. Thus, the ISR converges on chronic ATF4 activity in CD8(+) TILs as a barrier to ICI response, positioning ISR therapeutics as candidates for immunotherapy.	Immunity	2025 Sep 25
10.1016/j.jacc.2025.08.047	Inflammation and Cardiovascular Disease: 2025 ACC Scientific Statement: A Report	Mensah GA, Arnold N, Prabhu SD, Ridker PM, Welty FK	The crucial role of inflammation in the pathogenesis and clinical outcomes of cardiovascular disease (CVD) has recently gained increased attention. In particular, residual inflammation, measured with high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) remains strongly predictive of recurrent events, even in statin-treated patients. Similarly, elevated hsCRP in apparently healthy individuals identifies a higher-risk group in whom statin therapy significantly reduces the risk of first major CVD events even if LDL-cholesterol is normal. This report provides an updated understanding of the role of chronic, low-grade inflammation in CVD and highlights new seminal research findings, especially in atherosclerosis, myocardial infarction, heart failure, and pericarditis. Consensus recommendations are summarized for screening, evaluation, and CVD risk assessment; inflammatory biomarkers in cardiovascular imaging; inflammation inhibition in behavioral and lifestyle risks; and anti-inflammatory approaches in primary and secondary prevention as well as in heart failure and other CVDs. This report also addresses current challenges and future opportunities. For example, it cautions that not all trials of anti-inflammatory therapy in secondary prevention have been successful and such trial evidence is needed before broad recommendations for other agents can be made. Additionally, in successful trials, the interplay between inflammation and key physiological systems often remains incompletely examined. Another promising area of research is the role that novel special pro-resolving bioactive lipid molecules play in promoting the resolution of inflammation and CVD risk reduction. In aggregate, the evidence linking inflammation with atherosclerotic CVD is no longer exploratory but is compelling and clinically actionable. The time for taking action has now arrived.

10.1038/s41413-025-00456-7	Unraveling the mechanisms of bone diseases: targeting dendritic cells in	Chen Y, Wang S, Chen X, Wu Z, He F, Chen Q	Bone repair and regeneration is a complex spatiotemporal process recruiting a variety of cell types, which need to precisely mediated for effective healing post-damage. The concept of osteoimmunology emphasizes the extensive and intricate crosstalk between the bone and the immune system. Despite the significant advancements in understanding osteoimmunology, the precise role of dendritic cells (DCs) in this field remains under investigation. As key antigen-presenting cells, DCs are critical in orchestrating adaptive immune responses and maintaining tissue homeostasis. Recent researches have further revealed the potential of DCs to influence the development or acceleration of inflammatory and autoimmune bone disease, as well as their interaction with skeletal cells in the context of bone repair and regeneration. Therefore, an in-depth understanding of DCs in the osteoimmunology would be valuable. Herein, we discuss the effects of DCs on bone homeostasis and bone-related diseases (i.e., rheumatoid arthritis (RA), periodontitis, bone regeneration, and other bone abnormalities diseases), and introduce the innovative DCs-targeting biomaterials, aimed at promoting bone repair and regeneration. Furthermore, we summarize the underlying crosstalk between DCs and other cells (i.e., osteoclasts, mesenchymal stromal stem cells (MSCs), hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs), T and B cells) in the bone homeostasis and bone-related diseases. In conclusion, we propose that osteoimmunology offers a promising perspective for unraveling the mechanisms of bone-related diseases; meanwhile, targeting DCs from the perspective of osteoimmunology may provide innovative ideas and resolutions to achieve the internal homeostasis balance.

10.1186/s40168-025-02230-7	From gut to gamete: how the microbiome influences fertility and preconception	Munyoki SK, Vukmer N, Rios JM, Kallen A, Jašarević E	Global fertility rates continue to decline despite advancements in assisted reproductive technologies, highlighting a significant gap in our understanding of the mechanisms underlying preconception physiology. In this commentary, we review a growing body of work demonstrating that the microbiome plays a crucial yet underexplored role in women's reproductive health. This work has shown that microbial communities produce substrates that support metabolic, immune, and hormonal functions during this critical period, affecting fertility, pregnancy outcomes, and offspring health. Women with reproductive disorders, including endometriosis, polycystic ovarian syndrome, primary ovarian insufficiency, and recurrent pregnancy loss, harbor distinct microbial signatures. Animal studies provide key mechanistic insights, showing that disruption of microbiota accelerates ovarian aging, but translating these findings to human preconception health requires careful consideration. While these findings are compelling, this emerging field currently lacks a clear understanding of how microbial signals affect reproductive tissues through metabolites, immune responses, or hormonal pathways. We outline criteria for establishing microbial causation in preconception health, including sufficiency, necessity, specificity, and timing. Moving beyond correlations involves selecting appropriate models, focusing on key developmental windows, conducting longitudinal studies before conception, and investigating how specific microbial metabolites influence reproductive outcomes. Incorporating microbiome research into preconception care could lead to the development of new therapies and interventions. While the principles outlined here primarily address preconception reproductive health, they also offer a framework for microbiome research in general, emphasizing the need for a mechanistic understanding, timely interventions, and progress from association to causation in this rapidly evolving field.

Here, we employ the discriminative dimensionality reduction tree (DDRTree) method to routine clinical data from 18,733 Chinese individuals with obesity enrolled in the nationwide China Cardiometabolic Disease and Cancer Cohort (4C) study. We identify five distinct metabolic phenotypes, among which the phenotype characterized by hyperglycemia and insulin resistance exhibits a higher risk of glycemic deterioration, while the phenotype characterized by hypertension and dyslipidemia demonstrates an elevated risk of microvascular and macrovascular diseases. These findings are validated in an independent prospective cohort. Additionally, we reveal distinctive metabolomic features that contribute to the heterogeneity of obesity in the 4C study. To translate our findings into practice, we develop a user-friendly online tool to assess event risks in the obese population. Overall, our analysis illustrates the underlying phenotypic variations influencing subsequent obesity-related outcomes, emphasizing the importance of precision medicine in obesity management.

10.1177/1060028015606469	Association Between Prenatal Acetaminophen Exposure and Future Risk of Attention	Hoover RM, Hayes VA, Erramouspe J	OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of prenatal acetaminophen exposure on the future development of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children. DATA SOURCES: Literature searches of MEDLINE (1975 to June 2015), International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1975 to June 2015), and Cochrane Database (publications through June 2015) for prospective clinical trials assessing the relationship of prenatal acetaminophen exposure and the development of attention deficit disorders or hyperactivity. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: Studies comparing self-reported maternal acetaminophen use during pregnancy to development of ADHD or ADHD-like behaviors in offspring between the ages of 3 and 12 years. DATA SYNTHESIS: Four studies examining the effects of prenatal acetaminophen exposure on subsequent ADHD behaviors were identified. Of these, one early study found no link to ADHD behaviors while the other studies found statistically significant correlations with the most prominent being a study finding a higher risk for using ADHD medications (hazard ratio = 1.29; 95% CI, 1.15-1.44) or having ADHD-like behaviors at age 7 years as determined by the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (risk ratio = 1.13; 95% CI, 1.01-1.27) in children whose mothers used acetaminophen during pregnancy. CONCLUSION: While there does appear to be a mild correlation between prenatal acetaminophen use and the development of ADHD symptoms in children, current data do not provide sufficient evidence that prenatal acetaminophen exposure leads to development of ADHD symptoms late in life. Acetaminophen is a preferred option for pain management during pregnancy when compared with other medications such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or opioids for pyretic or pain relief.

Here, we developed a single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) immunotherapy cohort (N = 27) and a spatial transcriptomics cohort (N = 88) to elucidate metabolic crosstalk associated with therapeutic efficacy in TNBC. We illustrated that heme binding protein 2 (HEBP2)(high) tumor cells (featured by active glutathione metabolism) and CCL3(+) macrophages (characterized by oxidative metabolism) indicated immunotherapy efficacy and were quantitatively and spatially negatively correlated. HEBP2-mediated glutamine face-off between these cell types induced this phenomenon. Mechanistically, HEBP2 disrupted FOXA1 cytoplasmic phase separation, promoting its nuclear translocation to upregulate glutathione S-transferase P1 (GSTP1) expression and glutamine consumption in tumor cells. This metabolic shift induced ferroptosis of CCL3(+) macrophages, impairing the antitumor immunity. The utilization of a GSTP1 inhibitor sensitized TNBC to immunotherapy. Collectively, we delineate a tumor-macrophage metabolic checkpoint governed by the HEBP2/GSTP1 axis and pioneer single-cell-level immunometabolism as a paradigm for evaluating immunotherapeutic vulnerabilities.

10.1016/j.phymed.2025.157299	Enzyme-responsive liposomes target endoplasmic reticulum stress-mediated	Li C, Qian C, Zhang J, Huang Y, Zhao X, Su H, Hou Y, Li C	BACKGROUND: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by persistent synovial inflammation and joint destruction. Insufficient apoptosis of fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLSs) significantly contributes to the pathogenesis of RA by promoting hyperplasia and inflammatory cytokine secretion. Celastrol (CLT), a pentacyclic triterpene derived from Tripterygium wilfordii, has shown promise in inducing apoptosis via endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-mediated pathways. However, its clinical application is limited by poor solubility and off-target effects. Targeted delivery of CLT to FLSs and their ER could enhance therapeutic efficacy while minimizing toxicity. METHODS: We engineered CLT-loaded, enzyme-responsive liposomes (CLT-FELipos) functionalized with hyaluronic acid (HA), oligopeptide GPA (for FAP-α recognition on FLSs), an ER-targeting KDEL peptide, and cleavable PEG chains.

However, EXO1 loss is well-tolerated, suggesting the existence of compensatory mechanisms that could be exploited in DDR-deficient cancers. Using CRISPR screening, we find EXO1 loss as synthetic lethal with many DDR genes somatically inactivated in cancers, including Fanconi Anaemia (FA) pathway and BRCA1-A complex genes. We also identify the spliceosome factor and tumour suppressor ZRSR2 as synthetic lethal with loss of EXO1 and show that ZRSR2-deficient cells are attenuated for FA pathway activation, exhibiting cisplatin sensitivity and radial chromosome formation. Furthermore, FA or ZRSR2 deficiencies depend on EXO1 nuclease activity and can be potentiated in combination with PARP inhibitors or ionizing radiation. Finally, we uncover dysregulated replication-coupled repair as the driver of synthetic lethality between EXO1 and FA pathway attributable to defective fork reversal, elevated replication fork speeds, post-replicative single stranded DNA exposure and DNA damage. These findings implicate EXO1 as a synthetic lethal vulnerability and promising drug target in a broad spectrum of DDR-deficient cancers unaddressed by current therapies.

10.1007/s00421-010-1658-5	Association among basal serum BDNF, cardiorespiratory fitness and cardiovascular	Jung SH, Kim J, Davis JM, Blair SN, Cho HC	Evidence suggests that serum brain-derived neurotrophic factor (serum BDNF) can be affected by cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF), but this relationship is far from clear. Recent reports show an inverse relationship between serum BDNF and CRF in healthy individuals, and other studies suggest a possible association between serum BDNF and cardiovascular disease. However, the possible interaction between serum BDNF, CRF, and cardiovascular disease risk has not been studied. The purpose of this study was to examine the association among serum BDNF, CRF, and cardiovascular disease risk factors in healthy men. The investigation involved a large sample of men (n = 995, age range: 20-76 years) who live in the central area of South Korea and were recruited into the Preventive Health Study. Our study showed a significant inverse relationship between serum BDNF and relative VO(2)max (r = -0.412, p < 0.0001) and heart rate reserve (r = -0.194, p < 0.0001). Serum BDNF was positively correlated with body mass index (r = 0.80, p < 0.0001), total cholesterol (r = 0.185, p < 0.0001), and triglyceride (r = 0.320, p < 0.0001). Our data suggest that serum BDNF may be associated with effects of increased CRF on cardiovascular disease. However, more research is clearly needed before a determination of whether, and to what extent, serum BDNF may be responsible for some of the health benefits associated with CRF.

10.1126/sciadv.adx3827	USP13 stabilizes NLRP3 to facilitate inflammasome activation by preventing	Li YT, Li KY, Tao SS, Wang T, Lu Y, Chen H, Zhan YQ, Zhao K, Xiang SS, Li JJ, Gao HY, Yu M, Li CY, Wang L, Yang XM, Ren GM, Yin RH	NOD-, LRR-, and pyrin domain-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) has a fundamental role in host defense and is involved in diverse inflammatory diseases. NLRP3 protein expression is tightly controlled by the ubiquitin system. In particular, NLRP3 protein degradation has been extensively studied. In contrast, the mechanisms to stabilize NLRP3 protein are much less known. Here, we demonstrated the critical role of ubiquitin-specific protease 13 (USP13) in regulating NLRP3 protein stability and inflammasome activation independently of its deubiquitinating enzyme activity. USP13 competes with E3 ubiquitin ligase TRIM31 to interact with NLRP3 and prevents TRIM31-mediated NLRP3 ubiquitination at K192 and K496 sites, thereby inhibiting proteasomal degradation of NLRP3. USP13 deficiency reduces NLRP3 protein expression in both human and mouse macrophages, which consequently inhibits NLRP3 inflammasome assembly and activation. Accordingly, deficiency of USP13 attenuates monosodium urate crystal-induced mouse peritonitis. Overall, our findings reveal a previously unrecognized regulatory mechanism of NLRP3 stability by USP13 and provide a potential therapeutic target for NLRP3-driven diseases.

10.1186/s12879-025-11577-z	Molecular epidemiology and increasing macrolide resistance of Bordetella	Mai Q, Wen J, Luo Y, Guo J, Qin Y, Lai W, Deng W, Ji C, Mai R, Zheng M, Chen Z, Chen Y, Gu C, Guo L, Li H, Tang Y, Huang D, Luo M	BACKGROUND: Pertussis (whooping cough), a highly contagious respiratory disease caused by Bordetella pertussis, has resurged worldwide and requires increased attention. This study aimed to characterize the molecular epidemiology and antimicrobial susceptibility profiles of B. pertussis isolates circulating in Guangzhou, China. METHODS: A total of 91 culture-confirmed pertussis cases in Guangzhou between January 2020 and August 2024 were enrolled and studied. B. pertussis isolates (from January 2020 to May 2024) were recovered from 62 cases. All isolates underwent antigenic genotyping and phylogenetic analysis based on whole-genome sequencing. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing using E-test was performed on 12 representative isolates. RESULTS: The majority of culture-confirmed cases occurred in children under 1 year of age who were unvaccinated or partially vaccinated. Genotypic analysis revealed a significant shift: only 3 isolates (all from 2022) harbored the ptxP1 allele, while the remaining 59 exhibited ptxP3. Three types of pertactin (prn) allele were identified: prn1 (4.84%, 3/62), prn2 (11.29%, 7/62), prn150 (80.65%, 50/62), and 2 untyped prn allele. By 2024, prn150 became the predominant allele. Phylogenetic analysis revealed distinct branches separating ptxP1 and ptxP3 lineages. E-test results demonstrated that all macrolide-resistant isolates (exhibiting MICs > 256 mg/L for erythromycin, azithromycin, and clarithromycin) carried the A2047G mutation in 23S rRNA gene. The proportion of isolates harboring this mutation increased significantly after 2022 and dominated by 2024. All tested isolates displayed low MICs to alternative agents: trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (MICs ≤ 0.5/9.5 mg/L), cefoperazone/sulbactam (MICs ≤ 0.064/0.032 mg/L), and piperacillin/tazobactam (MICs ≤ 0.064/4 mg/L). Notably, macrolide-resistant isolates harboring ptxA1-ptxP3-prn150 genotype formed a distinct sub-clone within the ptxP3 clade. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate the current dominance of macrolide-resistant B. pertussis strain harboring ptxP3 and prn150 in Guangzhou since 2024. This study provides epidemiological and microbiological insights to guide local pertussis control strategies and to offer antimicrobial resistance monitoring efforts.

10.1016/j.ejca.2025.115808	Tecotabart vedotin in Claudin 18.2-positive advanced gastric/gastroesophageal	Bai C, Zheng Y, Sun M, Ying J, Zhou F, Yu Y, Xing L, Zhang Y, Wen J, Wu H, Yang X, Wan L, Guo S, Zhao R, Zhu Z, Shen W, Wang Q, Gu S, Wu H, Chen W, Xia J, Zhao J, Dong X, Lou W, Jiang K, Zhang Z, Chen X, Fu D, Chen Y, Wang B, Liu J, Ji Y, Yuan S, Li Y, Gong Z, Fei D, Qin X, Qin C, Li J	BACKGROUND: Tecotabart vedotin (LM-302) is a novel antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) targeting CLDN18.2, a promising therapeutic target in gastrointestinal cancers. This phase 1/2 study evaluated the safety, pharmacokinetics, immunogenicity, and preliminary anti-tumor activity of tecotabart vedotin in patients with advanced solid tumors, with a focus on CLDN18.2-positive gastric/gastroesophageal junction (G/GEJ) cancer. METHODS: This open-label, multicenter study utilized a Bayesian adaptive design. Phase 1 enrolled patients with advanced solid tumors; phase 2 focused on CLDN18.2-positive G/GEJ, pancreatic, biliary tract cancer, or gastrointestinal tumors with low to moderate CLDN18.2 expression. Tecotabart vedotin was administered at 0.2-2.8 mg/kg every 3 weeks (Q3W) or 1.8-2.0 mg/kg every 2 weeks (Q2W). Primary endpoints included dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) and safety in phase 1, and objective response rate (ORR) in phase 2. Secondary endpoints included safety, pharmacokinetics, immunogenicity, and other anti-tumor activity outcomes. RESULTS: Overall, 153 patients received tecotabart vedotin (phase 1: 38; phase 2: 115). DLTs occurred in 5 patients at higher dose levels. The maximum tolerated dose was 2.4 mg/kg Q3W; recommended phase 2 doses were 1.8 mg/kg Q2W and 2.4 mg/kg Q3W. Among 52 evaluable patients with CLDN18.2-positive G/GEJ cancer receiving 1.8 mg/kg Q2W, ORR was 32.7 % (95 % confidence interval [CI] 20.3-47.1), with median progression-free survival of 4.9 months (95 % CI 2.7-6.9), and overall survival of 10.9 months (95 % CI 9.1-17.1). Adverse events were manageable and consistent with monomethyl auristatin E-based ADCs. CONCLUSIONS: Tecotabart vedotin demonstrated encouraging anti-tumor activity and manageable safety in CLDN18.2-positive G/GEJ cancer, supporting further clinical development in gastrointestinal malignancies.

10.1186/s12974-025-03536-x	Dysregulation of cellular metabolism within the gut-brain axis is associated with	Devereaux J, Robinson AM, Stavely R, Davidson M, Filippone RT, Ephraim R, Kiatos D, Apostolopoulos V, Nurgali K	BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic debilitating condition significantly affecting patient quality of life. Although the exact aetiology remains unknown, accumulating evidence has shown that disruption of the gut-brain axis may be related to the occurrence and development of chronic intestinal inflammation. Psychological disorders are highly prevalent in patients with IBD. However, an association between altered behaviour and dysregulated metabolic pathways within the gut-brain axis is yet to be explored. METHODS: Metabolic multiplexed phenotyping system involving indirect calorimetry and flow-through respirometry monitors was used to assess energy metabolism in Winnie mice with spontaneous chronic colitis and C57BL/6 littermates. Depressive and anxiety-like behaviours were evaluated with light dark, open field, grooming, elevated plus maze, and forced swimming tests. To investigate underlying mechanisms of the metabolic changes in Winnie mice, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, fatty acid ß-oxidation, tricarboxylic acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation gene expressions were determined by transcriptome analysis using high-throughput sequencing of mRNA extracted from the distal colon and brain samples. RESULTS: Our findings showed that energy metabolism and spontaneous activity were reduced in Winnie mice corresponding to alterations in the expression of cellular metabolism-associated genes in the distal colon. Winnie mice displayed depressive and anxiety-like behaviours reflecting downregulation of glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, fatty acid ß-oxidation, tricarboxylic acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation in the distal colon and brain. Subsequent analyses showed pro-inflammatory cytokine expression was upregulated in the Winnie mouse brain. CONCLUSIONS: These data provide evidence that the dysregulation of cellular metabolism within the gut-brain axis underlies changes in behaviour and energy metabolism in chronic intestinal inflammation.

10.1186/s12937-025-01205-6	Association between relative fat mass and obstructive sleep apnea and the	Guo Q, Xu W, Wang C, Xie M, Wu Z, Zhang N, Zhang B, Mu D	BACKGROUND: Obesity has been identified as one of the contributing factors to obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). The current obesity assessment indicators have poor ability to distinguish between fat and muscle. Relative fat mass (RFM) a new indicator of obesity that takes into account gender differences and can predict body fat conditions has advantage in this respect. This study aimed to investigate the potential association between RFM and OSA, as well as the possible mediating effect of hypertension. METHODS: This cross-sectional study used data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey conducted in 2005-2008 and 2015-2018. Multivariate logistic regression, restricted cubic splines (RCS), and subgroup analyses were performed to evaluate the association between RFM and OSA. In addition, the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) of different obesity indicators was compared to assess their predictive ability for OSA. Mediation analysis was used to explore the potential mediating role of hypertension in the positive correlation. RESULTS: The study included 13,532 participants with complete study data, of which 6854 were assessed as having OSA according to the criteria, accounting for 50.65% of the study population. The results of the multivariate logistic regression model with fully adjusted covariates showed that the odds ratio of RFM was 1.096 (95%CI:1.084-1.109, P < 0.001). The results of the RCS show that RFM is nonlinearly correlated with OSA (P for nonlinear < 0.01). Subgroup analysis showed that the association between RFM and OSA was stronger in female and people younger than 60. The ROC also indicates that, compared with the body roundness index and weight-adjusted-waist index, RFM showed potential as a predictor. Mediation analysis and sensitivity analysis showed that hypertension had a statistically significant but poorly robust mediating effect between RFM and OSA. CONCLUSION: There is a positive and nonlinear correlation between RFM and OSA. Hypertension plays a potential mediating role in the positive association between RFM and OSA, but its robustness is poor. RFM shows potential as a predictor of OSA, but more prospective studies are needed to confirm these findings and determine the causal relationship between RFM and OSA.	Nutrition journal	2025 Sep 26
10.1186/s12884-025-08116-8	Non-coding RNAs as diagnostic biomarkers for preeclampsia: a systematic review	Liu J, Zhao Q, Zhu Y	BACKGROUND: Preeclampsia (PE), a grave obstetric complication, mandates the expeditious formulation of efficacious early diagnostic strategies. Accumulating evidence suggests that non - coding RNAs (ncRNAs), which are present in maternal circulation and placental tissues, display abnormal expression patterns in patients with PE, underscoring their potential as diagnostic biomarkers. This systematic review and meta - analysis intends to assess the diagnostic accuracy of ncRNAs for the detection of PE. METHODS: A comprehensive search was carried out across seven databases (China National Knowledge Infrastructure [CNKI], Wanfang Database, VIP Database, PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and the Cochrane Library) up to December 25, 2024, to identify case - control and cohort studies exploring the diagnostic value of ncRNAs in PE. The quality of the studies was evaluated using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies - 2 (QUADAS - 2) tool and the Newcastle - Ottawa Scale (NOS), and publication bias was assessed using Deeks' funnel plot. The pooled sensitivity (SEN), specificity (SPE), diagnostic odds ratio (DOR), and area under the curve (AUC) were computed using Review Manager 5.4 and Meta - DiSc 1.4. RESULTS: Among the 2,201 identified studies, 40 fulfilled the inclusion criteria for qualitative synthesis. Forty - eight ncRNAs showed diagnostic potential, including 25 microRNAs (miRNAs), 9 long non - coding RNAs (lncRNAs), and 6 circular RNAs (circRNAs). The pooled sensitivity and specificity were 80% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 76-84%) and 82% (95% CI: 79-85%), respectively. Single miRNA assays presented superior diagnostic performance (sensitivity [SEN]: 85%, specificity [SPE]: 85%) in comparison to circRNAs (SEN: 80%, SPE: 79%). Notably, combinatorial panels consisting of 2-3 ncRNAs attained optimal diagnostic performance, with a sensitivity of 91% (95% CI: 88-94%), a specificity of 80% (95% CI: 76-84%), and an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.9418 (standard error [SE] = 0.0152). CONCLUSION: Circulating ncRNAs exhibit significant potential as diagnostic biomarkers for PE, with multi-analyte panels providing improved diagnostic accuracy compared to single-marker strategies.

10.1016/j.celrep.2025.116336	IRG1 catalyzed energy metabolite itaconic acid restrains type I	Chai L, Li C, Wang X, Qin Y, Sun H, Du J, Yang L, Hu D, Xiong J, Zhao Z, Gong R, Wu T, Wu M, Nie M, Gao J, Jia J, Gao C, Zhao W, Zhou H, Kang D, Jia M	Perturbation of energy metabolism is an essential feature during infection and inflammation. TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) is crucial for initiating the innate immune response against viral infection, although aberrant and ongoing TBK1 activation induces excessive production of type I interferons (IFN-I). Nonetheless, the mechanisms whereby energy metabolism controls TBK1 activation remain unclear. Here, we elucidate a mechanism linking energy metabolism to the inhibition of TBK1-induced IFN-I responses via the immune response gene 1 (IRG1)-itaconic acid axis. Mechanistically, itaconic acid and its derivatives alkylated TBK1 at Cys605, thereby disrupting TBK1 dimerization and rapid activation. IRG1, the enzyme that catalyzes itaconic acid production, is upregulated during late-phase viral infection and acts as a feedback regulator to restrain TBK1 activity. We developed itaconic acid-based compounds ITA-5/ITA-9 as alternative TBK1 inhibitors. ITA-5/ITA-9 effectively limited excess	Cell reports	2025 Sep 26

Perturbations in the intricate interplay of transcriptional effectors within this network can lead to a variety of nervous system pathologies. In this study, we identify Gtf2i-encoded general transcription factor II-I (Tfii-i) as a regulator of key myelination-related genes. Gtf2i deletion from myelinating glial cells in male mice leads to functional alterations in central nervous system (CNS) myelin, including elevated mRNA and protein expression levels of myelin basic protein (Mbp), the central myelin component, enhanced connectivity properties, and thicker myelin wrapping axons with increased diameters. These changes resulted in faster axonal conduction across the corpus callosum (CC), and improved motor coordination. Furthermore, we show that in mature OLs (mOLs), Tfii-i directly binds to regulatory elements of Sox10 and Mbp. In the peripheral nervous system (PNS), Gtf2i deletion from Schwann cells (SCs) leads to hypermyelination of the tibial branch of the sciatic nerve (SN). These findings add to our understanding of myelination regulation and specifically elucidate a cell-autonomous mechanism for Tfii-i in myelinating glia transcriptional network.

However, there is a paucity of high-quality toxicity data, leading to an absence of evidence-based guidelines. DESIGN: To address this, ESMO and ESTRO initiated a series of systematic reviews followed by a Delphi consensus process to develop multidisciplinary, evidence-based consensus statements regarding the safety of combining RT with such agents. The current publication describes the combination of RT with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), vascular endothelial growth factor (receptor) (VEGF(R)) inhibitors, or multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). By systematically covering different drug classes and irradiated areas, 76 clinical scenarios were evaluated during two Delphi rounds with 20 international experts. Safety statements were developed for each scenario, based on the systematic literature reviews. RESULTS: A total of 5,921 records were screened during the systematic literature review process for ICIs, VEGF(R) inhibitors and multitargeted TKIs, and 159 reports were selected for inclusion in the final literature reviews and the database. During the two Delphi rounds, agreement was reached regarding the safety statements for 74 clinical scenarios. CONCLUSIONS: Generally, the expected toxicity of combining RT with ICIs is low, particularly for PD-(L)1 inhibitors. For most combinations with VEGF(R) inhibitors and multitargeted TKIs, exercising caution is recommended. The evidence-based safety statements developed during this comprehensive project, provide practical guidance on combining RT with targeted cancer therapies and immunotherapy.

10.1186/s40001-025-03147-5	Machine learning and nomogram prediction model to explore the relationship	Zou L, Zhao J, Ruan Y, Wang Y	BACKGROUND: Asthma is a prevalent chronic respiratory disease with significant morbidity and healthcare burden. Identifying novel biomarkers for asthma risk prediction is crucial for early intervention and personalized management. The monocyte-to-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio (MHR) has emerged as a potential inflammatory marker in various chronic diseases. This study aimed to investigate the association between MHR and asthma risk using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) and to develop a predictive model for asthma risk incorporating MHR and other clinical variables. METHODS: Data from NHANES (2001-2018) were used. Weighted logistic regression was employed to assess the relationship between MHR and asthma risk. Participants were randomly divided into training (70%) and validation (30%) cohorts. The Boruta algorithm was used to evaluate the training cohort, select the best model, and identify potential confounding factors. A nomogram-based predictive model was constructed using variables selected by the Boruta algorithm [smoke, age, hypertension, cardiovascular disease (CVD), marital status, gender, race, poverty-income ratio (PIR), body mass index (BMI), cancer, education, diabetes, and MHR]. The model's performance was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, calibration curves, and decision curve analysis (DCA) curves. The variables selected by Boruta algorithm are included in the machine learning (ML) model for analysis. SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) analysis was performed to assess the contribution of each variable. RESULTS: A total of 28,855 participants were included after excluding those with missing data. MHR was positively associated with asthma incidence (P < 0.05). The Boruta algorithm achieved an AUC of 0.64 in the validation cohort. Among the ML models, the Xgboost model demonstrated the best performance with an AUC of 0.640 (95% CI 0.623-0.656). SHAP analysis identified CVD as the most influential factor, followed by age, BMI, PIR, and gender. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates a positive association between the MHR and asthma risk, indicating a significant cross-sectional relationship. The nomogram-based predictive model incorporating MHR and other clinical variables showed moderate discriminative ability.	European journal of medical research	2025 Sep 26
10.1038/s41418-025-01588-3	Epithelial MST1 deficiency promotes pyroptosis and aggravates inflammatory bowel	Lu J, Li F, Wang H, Yu Y, Yuan Y, Zhang Y, Liu P, Zhao Q, Wu M, Ye M	The Hippo pathway has been implicated in the onset and pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), with Mammalian STE20-like kinase 1 (MST1), a core kinase in this pathway, playing significant roles in inflammation and immune regulation. However, the specific role of MST1 in IBD remains largely undefined. In this study, we observed that MST1 expression was significantly decreased in IBD patients and acute colitis mice. Intestinal epithelial cell-specific MST1 knockout mice exhibited heightened susceptibility to dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis, characterized by severe disruption of intestinal epithelial barrier and markedly increased epithelial cell pyroptosis, thus exacerbating intestinal inflammation. Pharmacological inhibition of caspase-1/GSDMD-mediated pyroptosis ameliorated the detrimental effects of MST1 deficiency in colitis. Consistently, MST1 deficiency exacerbated intestinal barrier disruption and pyroptosis in both in vivo and in vitro models under TNFα-induced inflammation and DNA damage. Mechanistically, MST1 depletion promoted YAP nuclear translocation and enhances its interaction with p73 in intestinal epithelial cells, leading to increased p73 stability and transcriptional activity. This, in turn, facilitated the recruitment of p73 to the caspase-1 promoter, upregulating caspase-1 expression and translating into increased pyroptosis under TNFα-induced inflammatory conditions. Altogether, our findings highlight the critical role of MST1 in maintaining intestinal mucosal barrier homeostasis by regulating epithelial cell pyroptosis via the YAP/p73 signaling pathway. Reduced MST1 expression may correlate with a better response to anti-TNF therapy in IBD patients. Consequently, MST1 could serve as a promising predictive biomarker for anti-TNF therapy responsiveness and a potential therapeutic target for IBD, offering valuable insights for personalized treatment strategies.

10.1177/0018720819875376	A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Direct Objective Measures of Situation	Endsley MR	OBJECTIVE: To examine evidence of sensitivity, predictiveness, and methodological concerns regarding direct, objective measures of situation awareness (SA). BACKGROUND: The ability to objectively measure SA is important to the evaluation of user interfaces and displays, training programs, and automation initiatives, as well as for studies that seek to better understand SA in both individuals and teams. A number of methodological criticisms have been raised creating significant confusion in the research field. METHOD: A meta-analysis of 243 studies was conducted to examine evidence of sensitivity and predictiveness, and to address methodological questions regarding Situation Awareness Global Assessment Technique (SAGAT), Situation Present Assessment Technique (SPAM), and their variants. RESULTS: SAGAT and SPAM were found to be equally predictive of performance. SPAM (64%) and real-time probes (73%) were found to have significantly lower sensitivity in comparison to SAGAT (94%). While SAGAT was found not to be overly memory reliant nor intrusive into operator performance, SPAM resulted in problems with intrusiveness in 40% of the studies examined, as well as problems with speed-accuracy tradeoffs, sampling bias, and confounds with workload. Concerns about memory reliance, the utility of these measures for assessing Team SA, and other issues are also addressed. CONCLUSION: SAGAT was found to be a highly sensitive, reliable, and predictive measure of SA that is useful across a wide variety of domains and experimental settings. APPLICATION: Direct, objective SA measurement provides useful and diagnostic insights for research and design in a wide variety of domains and study objectives.	Human factors	2021 Feb

Currently, accurate diagnosis for AD relies on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) sampling or a positron emission tomography (PET) scan, methods that cannot be done in primary care centers where most people go with cognitive complaints. This Limitation calls for the urgent need to develop blood-related diagnostic tests that could facilitate early detection and enable timely treatment. Recent CSF proteomic research categorized AD into five molecular subtypes with discrete Genetic risk profiles. Subtypes 1-3, namely neuronal hyperplasticity, innate immune activation, and RNA dysregulation, were characterized by more classical AD-related changes, like accumulation of amyloid/tau and synaptic and immune dysfunction, respectively. On the contrary, non-traditional AD mechanisms in subtypes 4-5 were choroid plexus (CP) dysfunction and blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction, emphasizing clearance deficits in association with brain barrier dysfunction. The unchanged tau levels later may be explained by an alternate disease mechanism (clearance dysfunction). These subtypes included BBB and CP dysfunction. Biomarker identification based on the mechanism of disease progression would increase the precision of diagnoses, allowing for tailored interventions and aiding in the creation of novel therapies for subtypes that might not react favorably to conventional amyloid/tau-targeting strategies. Finding biomarkers specific to each subtype would aid in patient classification, resulting in more individualized therapy as opposed to a ""one-size-fits-all"" strategy. The present review emphasized the importance of identifying blood-based biomarkers (BBMs) related to brain barrier dysfunction from CSF studies and personalized treatment strategies to streamline the diagnostic workup, and may be utilized in standard clinical practice for the early detection of AD."

10.1093/ageing/afaf273	Impact of pre-existing frailty on all-cause mortality in stroke survivors: a	Wang S, Tan J, Song K, Zhang Q, Yang W, Wu Y	BACKGROUND: The association between pre-existing frailty and increased mortality in stroke survivors remains unclear, with prior studies reporting inconsistent findings. This meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the impact of pre-stroke frailty on all-cause mortality in this population. METHODS: We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, PsycINFO, CNKI, Wanfang, VIP, and SinoMed databases up to November 12, 2024. Study selection and data extraction were independently performed by two investigators. Studies using validated frailty assessment tools and reporting adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) or odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were included. RESULTS: Sixteen studies involving 55,897 patients met the inclusion criteria. The prevalence of frailty among stroke survivors ranged from 11.2% to 75.3%. Meta-analysis showed that pre-stroke frailty was significantly associated with increased all-cause mortality (pooled HR = 2.19, 95% CI: 1.44-3.34; pooled OR for continuous frailty scores = 1.26, 95% CI: 1.14-1.38). Dose-response analysis revealed a linear relationship, with each one-point increase in frailty score associated with a 6.4% higher risk of death (HR = 1.064, 95% CI: 1.031-1.098). Subgroup analyses indicated that the association was particularly strong in acute ischemic stroke populations (OR = 3.43, 95% CI: 1.81-6.51). The type of frailty assessment tool and study sample size were identified as potential sources of heterogeneity. CONCLUSION: Pre-stroke frailty independently predicts all-cause mortality in stroke survivors. Even mild increases in frailty burden are associated with worse outcomes, highlighting the clinical importance of incorporating frailty assessment into prognostic evaluation.

Synaptic dysfunction is suggested to play a major role in FTD pathogenesis. Disturbances in the synaptic function can also be associated with the C9orf72 repeat expansion (C9-HRE), the most common genetic mutation causing FTD. C9-HRE leads to distinct pathological hallmarks, such as C9orf72 haploinsufficiency and development of toxic RNA foci and dipeptide repeat proteins (DPRs). FTD patient brains, including those carrying the C9-HRE, are also characterized by neuropathologies involving accumulation of	Molecular psychiatry	2025 Sep 26
10.1007/s00520-025-09918-4	Strategies for premedication and G-CSF application in sacituzumab govitecan	Pieniążek M, Polakiewicz-Gilowska A, Kubeczko M, Las-Jankowska M, Pacholczak-Madej R, Kilian-Van Miegem P, Ziobro M, Łacko A, Jarząb M, Püsküllüoğlu M	BACKGROUND: Sacituzumab govitecan (SG) is approved for advanced triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) in the second-line setting and beyond, offering improved survival compared to chemotherapy. Adverse events (AEs) commonly include myelosuppression, gastrointestinal disturbances, and hepatic toxicity. Effective premedication and prophylaxis are critical for AE management. This study assessed premedication protocols for SG-treated TNBC patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective cohort study across five oncology centers in Poland analyzed premedication regimens for patients completing SG treatment by October 2024. Premedication evaluated included acetaminophen, corticosteroids, antihistamines, 5-HT3 and NK1 receptor antagonists, and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) when needed. AEs were assessed using National Cancer Institute-Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 5.0. RESULTS: Among 67 patients with TNBC who finished their treatment with SG, the mean age at SG initiation was 51.5 ± 12.4 years. Premedication in the first cycle included corticosteroids and 5-HT3 receptor antagonists in 66 (99%) and 65 (97%) patients, respectively; acetaminophen in 57 patients (85%), H1 blockers in 53 patients (79%), and H2 blockers in 52 patients (78%). G-CSF was used as primary prophylaxis in 27 patients (40%) and required in 53 patients (79%) during treatment. Atropine premedication was needed in 4 patients (6%) for grade 3 diarrhea as secondary prophylaxis. CONCLUSIONS: Most patients received standardized premedication regimens, but significant variability was observed in G-CSF use for neutropenia prophylaxis. Only 6% of patients required atropine as diarrhea premedication. Practices regarding the use of G-CSF varied across centers, reflecting evolving SmPC guidance and individual risk-based approaches to neutropenia management.

This study aimed to investigate the protective effects of zinc picolinate supplementation in a rat model of acetic acid (AA)-induced colitis. Male Sprague Dawley rats (n = 49) were divided into control (saline, zinc, or zinc picolinate) and colitis (saline, zinc, zinc picolinate, or sulfasalazine) groups. The agents were administered intraperitoneally (6 mg/kg) or orally (sulfasalazine, 100 mg/kg) for 10 days before colitis induction with AA (1 ml, 5%). Colon tissues were collected for macroscopic, oxidative, biochemical, and molecular analyses. In the colitis group pretreated with saline, fecal, macroscopic, and edema scores, as well as malondialdehyde (MDA), myeloperoxidase (MPO), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-6, and histopathological scores, were significantly increased compared to controls (p < 0.01-0.001). In contrast, zinc, antioxidant glutathione (GSH), occludin, and claudin-1 levels were reduced (p < 0.01-0.001). Zinc and zinc picolinate pretreatments attenuated colonic damage, oxidative stress, and inflammation while enhancing antioxidant status and tight junction proteins (p < 0.05-0.001). These findings suggest that zinc picolinate may exert protective effects against experimental colitis by reducing oxidative and inflammatory damage and supporting intestinal barrier integrity.

10.3390/nu17182984	Microbiota Gut-Brain Axis and Autism Spectrum Disorder: Mechanisms and	Petropoulos A, Stavropoulou E, Tsigalou C, Bezirtzoglou E	"Background/Objectives: Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental condition often accompanied by gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms and gut microbiota imbalances. The microbiota-gut-brain (MGB) axis is a bidirectional communication network linking gut microbes, the GI system, and the central nervous system (CNS). This narrative review explores the role of the MGB axis in ASD pathophysiology, focusing on communication pathways, neurodevelopmental implications, gut microbiota alteration, GI dysfunction, and emerging therapeutics. Methods: A narrative review methodology was employed. We searched major scientific databases including PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar for research on MGB axis mechanisms, gut microbiota composition in ASD, dysbiosis, leaky gut, immune activation, GI disorders, and intervention (probiotics, prebiotics, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), antibiotics and diet). Key findings from recent human, animal and in vitro studies were synthesized thematically, emphasizing mechanistic insights and therapeutic outcomes. Original references from the initial manuscript draft were retained and supplemented for comprehensiveness and accuracy. Results: The MGB axis involves neuroanatomical, neuroendocrine, immunological, and metabolic pathways that enable microbes to influence brain development and function. Individuals with ASD commonly exhibit gut dysbiosis characterized by reduced microbial diversity (notably lower Bifidobacterium and Firmicutes) and overpresentation of potentially pathogenic taxa (e.g., Clostridia, Desulfovibrio, Enterobacteriaceae). Dysbiosis is associated with increased intestinal permeability (""leaky gut"") and newly activated and altered microbial metabolite profiles, such as short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and lipopolysaccharides (LPSs). Functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) are prevalent in ASD, linking gut-brain axis dysfunction to behavioral severity. Therapeutically, probiotics and prebiotics can restore eubiosis, fortify the gut barrier, and reduce neuroinflammation, showing modest improvements in GI and behavioral symptoms. FMT and Microbiota Transfer Therapy (MTT) have yielded promising results in open label trials, improving GI function and some ASD behaviors. Antibiotic interventions (e.g., vancomycin) have been found to temporarily alleviate ASD symptoms associated with Clostridiales overgrowth, while nutritional strategies (high-fiber, gluten-free, or ketogenic diets) may modulate the microbiome and influence outcomes. Conclusions: Accumulating evidence implicates the MGB axis in ASD pathogenesis. Gut microbiota dysbiosis and the related GI pathology may exacerbate neurodevelopmental and behavioral symptoms via immune, endocrine and neural routes. Interventions targeting the gut ecosystem, through diet modification, probiotics, symbiotics, or microbiota transplants, offer therapeutic promise. However, heterogeneity in findings underscores the need for rigorous, large-scale studies to clarify causal relationships and evaluate long-term efficacy and safety. Understanding MGB axis mechanisms in ASD could pave the way for novel adjunctive treatments to improve the quality of life for individuals with ASD."	Nutrients	2025 Sep 17
10.4088/JCP.18m12612	Prenatal Exposure to Acetaminophen and the Risk of	Chen MH, Pan TL, Wang PW, Hsu JW, Huang KL, Su TP, Li CT, Lin WC, Tsai SJ, Chen TJ, Bai YM	BACKGROUND: Studies have suggested that a significant association exists between prenatal exposure to acetaminophen and the offspring's attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) risk. However, this association has largely been unexplored among the Asian population, generally, and the Taiwanese population, specifically. METHODS: In our study, 950 study pairs (children with ADHD [ICD-9-CM code: 314] and their mothers) and 3,800 control pairs (children without ADHD and their mothers) matched by demographic characteristics were identified between 1998 and 2008 from the Taiwan Longitudinal Health Insurance Database. Maternal use of acetaminophen was assessed in the first trimester, second trimester, and third trimester of pregnancy and over the period from 3 months before pregnancy to the date of last menstrual cycle. RESULTS: Logistic regression analysis with adjustments for demographic data, gestational infections, comorbid perinatal conditions, and maternal mental health disorders indicated that exposure to acetaminophen in the second trimester (odds ratio [OR] = 1.19; 95% CI, 1.00-1.40), both the first and second trimesters (OR = 1.28; 95% CI, 1.00-1.64), or in any trimester (OR = 1.20; 95% CI, 1.01-1.42) was associated with an increased risk of ADHD in offspring. Sensitivity analysis excluding gestational infections and maternal mental health disorders confirmed this association (OR = 1.33; 95% CI, 1.04-1.69). CONCLUSION: Prenatal exposure to acetaminophen was associated with an increased risk of ADHD in offspring, regardless of gestational infections and maternal mental health disorders. Additional studies are necessary to clarify the underlying mechanisms by which prenatal exposure to acetaminophen leads to neurodevelopmental risks.	The Journal of clinical psychiatry	2019 Sep 10

Despite significant advances, the management of DME remains a dynamic field with many unresolved controversies. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) allows objective assessment, however, correlation between vision and morphological changes can be inconsistent, causing disagreements on treatment strategies. DME is a complex disease with multifactorial pathophysiological pathways, leading to heterogenous treatment responses. There is a lack of standardized definition of treatment 'non-response"" and protocol for switching to second-line or adjuvant treatments. New anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) drugs and multi-targeted therapies seem to demonstrate improved durability, but long-term data is not yet available. Research in artificial intelligence (AI) is developing rapidly, however, rigorous appraisal of its reliability and generalizability are necessary before its implementation. Significant vision loss from DME in pregnant women, young children and elderly patients with systemic comorbidities are challenging conundrums. An international panel of experts (IPE) comprising 36 experts from 16 countries formulated and voted on the consensus statements in 5 key areas: 1) Diagnostic controversies around classification and imaging; 2) Treatment controversies; 3) Management paradigm between protocol-based and individualized approaches; 4) Emerging controversies in novel therapeutics and AI application, and 5) Special considerations for specific patient populations. There is an imminent need for mutual agreement on the best-possible approach to DME management in order to promote the optimal patient outcomes and to identify specific issues that require prioritization of resources and research."

10.1038/s41556-025-01764-0	Remote control of AMPK via extracellular adenosine controls tissue growth.	Zhang Y, Strassburger K, Teleman AA	Adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a regulator of cellular catabolism that is activated by AMP. As AMP accumulates in cells with low ATP, AMPK is considered a stress-activated kinase. While studying organ growth during Drosophila development, we find that AMPK can also be activated by a signalling metabolite not related to stress. Specifically, we find that two physiological inputs known to regulate organ growth rates (ecdysone (a steroid hormone) and dietary protein) modulate expression of adenosine deaminase in the intestine. This, in turn, alters circulating adenosine levels. Circulating adenosine acts as a signalling molecule by entering cells, becoming phosphorylated to AMP and activating AMPK to inhibit organ growth. Thus, AMPK activity is regulated developmentally, and AMPK activity in one tissue can be remote controlled by another tissue via circulating adenosine. Notably, this mechanism accounts for half the effect of dietary protein on tissue growth rates in Drosophila.	Nature cell biology	2025 Sep 26

METHODS: We systematically searched MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane Library for randomized controlled trials comparing once-weekly tirzepatide (5-15 mg) versus placebo in adults with or without diabetes for at least 26 weeks. For each subpopulation analysis, the random-effects model was used to calculate pooled risk ratios (RRs) and mean differences (MDs), with their 95% confidence intervals, for dichotomous and continuous endpoints, respectively. Statistical significance was considered at p < 0.05. RESULTS: We included five trials (n = 2,174) in patients with diabetes (BMI ≥ 23 kg/m(2)) and five (n = 4,467) in patients without diabetes (BMI ≥ 27 [≥24 in Asia] kg/m(2)). Compared with placebo, tirzepatide led to significantly greater relative and absolute weight reductions in patients with (RR -9.54%, p < 0.01; MD -9.06 kg, p < 0.01) and without diabetes (RR -17.15%, p < 0.01; MD -18.11 kg, p < 0.01). In both subpopulations, tirzepatide also significantly increased the probability of achieving weight reductions of ≥5%, ≥10%, and ≥15%, as well as improved BMI, waist circumference, blood pressure, hemoglobin A1c, and lipid levels. Notably, weight-related benefits with tirzepatide were significantly greater in patients without diabetes, whereas its safety was similar across subpopulations and predominantly consisted of mild to moderate, well-tolerated adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with placebo, tirzepatide resulted in statistically significant and clinically meaningful weight reduction, especially in patients without diabetes (with overweight/obesity), with an acceptable safety profile.

10.3390/biom15091284	The Impact of Glucagon-like Peptide-1 Receptor Agonists on Erectile Function:	Kounatidis D, Vallianou NG, Rebelos E, Vallianou K, Diakoumopoulou E, Makrilakis K, Tentolouris N	Erectile dysfunction (ED) is a common yet frequently underrecognized microvascular complication of diabetes, affecting up to three out of four individuals. Key contributing factors include advancing age, long-standing disease duration, and suboptimal glycemic control, as well as insulin resistance and androgen deficiency-the latter being particularly common in men with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and obesity. While numerous studies have investigated the effects of various antidiabetic therapies on diabetes-related ED, the results remain inconsistent, limiting definitive conclusions. In recent years, increasing attention has focused on a novel class of antidiabetic medications, namely glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs). These agents have become central to the treatment of T2D due to their potent glucose-lowering properties and well-documented benefits on cardiovascular outcomes, and weight loss. Given these pleiotropic effects, GLP-1 RAs have been presumed to positively influence erectile function-a hypothesis supported by a growing body of experimental and clinical research. However, preliminary reports have also raised concerns about a possible association between GLP-1 RA use and ED. This narrative review aims to synthesize current evidence regarding the impact of GLP-1 RAs on erectile function, providing a platform for future research in this evolving field.

10.1186/s13024-025-00877-2	Autophagic impairment in sleep-wake circuitry is linked to sleep loss at the	Morrone CD, Tsang AA, Yu WH	BACKGROUND: Proteostasis, in particular the impairment of autophagic activity, is linked to sleep dysregulation and is an early sign of dementias including Alzheimer's disease (AD). This coupling of events may be a critical alteration driving proteinopathy and AD progression. In the present study, we investigated sleep-wake and memory regulating neurons for vulnerability to autophagic impediment, and related these findings to progression of the sleep and cognitive phenotype.  METHODS: Using the double knock-in AD mouse model, App(NL-G-F)xMAPT, we examined phenotypic and pathological alterations at several timepoints and compared to age-matched single knock-in MAPT mice. Spatial learning, memory and executive Function were investigated in the Barnes maze. Sleep was investigated by 24-h locomotor activity and EEG. Immunostaining for autophagic, neuronal and pathological markers was conducted in brain regions related to memory (hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, entorhinal cortex) and the sleep-wake cycle (hypothalamus, locus coeruleus). Hippocampal electrophysiological recordings were conducted to probe neuronal Function during object investigation. A 3-day sleep disruption was conducted in MAPT mice to investigate autophagic changes following sleep loss. Autophagy was activated in MAPT mice with trehalose to probe effects on sleep recovery. RESULTS: We identified that disrupted sleep occurred from early-stages in App(NL-G-F)xMAPT mice, that sleep declined over age, and sleep deficits preceded cognitive impairments in late-stages. Cytoplasmic autophagic impediment in hypothalamic and locus coeruleus sleep-wake neurons occurred in early-stage App(NL-G-F)xMAPT mice, prior to significant β-amyloid deposition in these regions, with a failure of lysosomal flux over disease progression. Autophagic changes in the hippocampus and cortex at early-stage were predominantly in processes and less frequently associated with the lysosome. Plaque-associated autophagic and lysosomal accumulations were frequent from the early-stage. Sex differences in the AD phenotype were prominent, including greater cognitive decline in males than females, linked to increased proteostasis burden in EC layer II neurons and hippocampal tau in the late-stage. Conversely, sleep impairments were more rapid in females including less REM sleep recovery than males, along with greater autophagic burden in hippocampal processes of female App(NL-G-F)xMAPT mice. We probed the sleep-cognition linkage demonstrating hippocampal electrophysiological slowing during cognitive processing in mid-stage App(NL-G-F)xMAPT mice, prior to cognitive decline. We provide evidence for a positive feedback loop in the autophagic-sleep relationship by demonstrating that disrupted sleep in MAPT mice led to arrhythmic sleep patterns and accumulations of autophagic aggregates in the hippocampus and hypothalamus, similar to as was seen in the early Alzheimer's phenotype. We further probed the autophagy-sleep linkage by treating MAPT mice with trehalose to activate autophagy and demonstrate an improvement in sleep recovery following a sleep disruption. CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate the vulnerability of sleep-regulating neurons to proteostatic dysfunction and the sleep-autophagy linkage as an early, and treatable, Alzheimer's disease mechanism.

Astrocytes play key roles in AD pathogenesis. Natural products show promise for treating AD through modulating amyloid-beta (Aβ) and tau pathology, inhibiting neuroinflammation and oxidative stress, and protecting cellular organelles. Preclinical evidence supports their efficacy in targeting astrocyte-related mechanisms, enhancing cognition, and reducing neuronal damage. PURPOSE: Systematically summarize and evaluate the medicinal benefits of plant-derived natural products in modulating astrocyte-mediated processes to attenuate AD progression. METHODS: A comprehensive literature review was performed in PubMed and Web of Science, utilizing targeted keywords such as ""natural products"", ""active compounds"", ""Alzheimer's disease"", and ""astrocytes"". The review primarily focused on studies published between 2013 and 2024, with the selected literature systematically categorized and analyzed. RESULTS: This review highlights the medicinal benefits of plant-derived natural products, such as flavonoids, alkaloids, polyphenols, and terpenes in targeting astrocyte morphology and function to combat AD. These bioactive compounds modulate key pathological processes, including neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, Aβ metabolism, tau hyperphosphorylation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and ER stress, outlining pathways to alleviate AD through astrocytic effects. The review also summarizes clinical progress and major challenges in translating these compounds, such as variability, low bioavailability, and delivery limitations. CONCLUSION: This study addresses a critical gap by systematically elucidating the relationship between astrocytes and AD, and therapeutic potential of plant-derived natural products. It aims to expand treatment options for patients and advance the development of therapeutic strategies in the field of AD management."

10.1186/s40001-025-03131-z	Association of eight anthropometric indexes related to obesity with the	Huang J, Zhang X, Tang H, Jia S, Chen J, Liang R, Yang Q, Lin H, Luo N, Ren Y, Lin J, Zhang X	OBJECTIVE: The aim of the current study is to investigate the association between clinical osteoarthritis (OA) and eight anthropometric indexes related to obesity, including non-hematological indexes (body mass index [BMI], body roundness index [BRI], weight-adjusted waist index [WWI], and waist-height ratio [WHtR]), and hematological indexes (triglyceride-glucose index [TyG], lipid accumulation product [LAP], visceral adiposity index [VAI], and waist triglyceride index [WTI]). METHODS: Utilizing data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) spanning the years 2005-2018, a total of 19,867 adults (aged ≥ 20 years) were examined. Eight anthropometric indexes were calculated. Clinical OA was assessed through participants' self-reported responses by questionnaires. Multivariable logistic regression analysis and secondary analysis such as restricted cubic splines (RCS), receiver operating characteristic (ROC), decision curve analysis (DCA) and the area under the curve (AUC) analysis were employed to investigate the associations between anthropometric indexes and clinical OA. RESULTS: The average age of the participants was 46.94 and 49.98% were female. Multivariable logistic regression analysis demonstrated significant associations between all indexes and clinical OA, especially BMI (per 1 standard deviation [SD], odd ration [OR] [95% Confidence interval [CI]] = 1.52[1.40, 1.66]), WTI (OR [95%CI] = 1.50[1.36, 1.65]) and WHtR (OR [95%CI] = 1.50[1.36, 1.64]). Latent profile analysis showed higher indexes could increase clinical OA risk. Additionally, AUC of WWI was the highest, at 0.6724, and DCA indicated that net profit of WWI was higher than other indexes when threshold was below 25%. The results of subgroup analysis proved the robustness of the findings in different sub-populations. CONCLUSION: Eight anthropometric indexes related to obesity were all significantly positively associated with clinical OA. Particularly, non-hematological indexes such as WWI and WHtR may show better efficacy in predicting and interventions for clinical OA outcomes, indicating their potential as the preferred strategy for early detection and management of clinical OA.

Buonocore J, Iaccino N, Torchia G, Curcio F, Pirrotta FM, Contrada M, Pucci C, Gambardella A, Quattrone A, Pilotto A, Pignolo L, Arabia G	BACKGROUND: Cognitive impairment is among the most frequent and disabling non-motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD), often emerging early and substantially impacting autonomy and quality of life. While cognitive stimulation (CS) is supported in other neurodegenerative conditions, its role in PD is less explored. This study aimed to compare the efficacy of a therapist-guided, home-based CS program, delivered via a virtual reality rehabilitation system, with a conventional in-person CS intervention. METHODS: Of 123 individuals screened, 45 patients with PD and mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI) were randomized to either the tele-rehabilitation group (TRG; n = 25) or the control group (CG; n = 20). Both groups received the same standardized 4-week CS program (20 multi-domain sessions, 5 days/week), targeting memory, attention, executive functions, language, and visuospatial skills. The TRG trained at home via the VRRS platform under remote supervision, while the CG attended outpatient sessions. Neuropsychological and clinical outcomes were assessed at baseline (T1), post-intervention (T2), and 6-month follow-up (T3). Analyses included repeated-measures ANOVA, multivariate linear regression, and categorical comparisons based on predefined clinical cut-offs. RESULTS: All participants completed the intervention with adherence exceeding 90% in both groups. At T2, the TRG showed greater improvements than the CG in global cognition, working memory, and delayed recall. These effects remained significant after adjusting for age, sex, baseline performance, and cognitive reserve index, and were robust to false discovery rate correction. Regression models confirmed these improvements. Categorical analyses also showed a marked reduction in pathological scores in the TRG in the same domains. CONCLUSION: A short-term, therapist-guided CS program delivered via tele-rehabilitation effectively improved cognitive functioning in PD-MCI, with partial benefits maintained at 6 months, especially in memory and executive domains. The intervention was particularly beneficial for memory and executive functions, highlighting telemedicine as a promising and accessible option for cognitive care in PD.

10.1016/j.tem.2025.09.004	Mechanisms and therapeutic insights into MASH-associated fibrosis.	Zhu Y, Cai B	Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) is a progressive liver disease posing a major global health concern, closely related to the rising prevalence of obesity. Liver fibrosis is the primary determinant of adverse outcomes in MASH. The increasing worldwide prevalence, economic impact, and adverse outcomes of MASH-associated fibrosis have spurred extensive research to elucidate its pathogenesis and to address its treatment. However, the intricate mechanism driving the transition from metabolic dysfunction to clinically significant fibrosis is not fully understood. Moreover, effective therapies, particularly direct antifibrotic agents, are still lacking, despite the recent approval of resmetirom and semaglutide for MASH-associated fibrosis. Here, we review current insights into the mechanism of MASH-associated fibrosis and provide a comprehensive overview of emerging therapeutic strategies.

In treatment-refractory SLE, we show that peripheral CD19(⁺) B cells and bone marrow CD19⁻BCMA⁺ long-lived plasma cells are dominant autoantibody sources, motivating dual CD19 and BCMA targeting. Here we report results from a cohort of patients (14 female, one male) in an ongoing phase 1 dose-escalation trial of co-infused autologous anti-CD19 and anti-BCMA chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells after fludarabine/cyclophosphamide lymphodepletion. Primary endpoints were dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) within 28 days and adverse events within 12 weeks; key secondary endpoints comprised attainment of Lupus Low Disease Activity State (LLDAS) and DORIS remission within 12 weeks and in vivo CAR-T persistence within 24 weeks. Exploratory endpoints were the duration of post-infusion B cell depletion and time to recovery, the kinetics of immune reconstitution and longitudinal changes in autoantibody titers and serum immunoglobulin concentrations after CAR-T therapy. Over a median 712-day follow-up (range, 613-1,134), no DLTs occurred. Grade 1 cytokine release syndrome developed in 86.7% of patients, with no neurotoxicity or treatment-related deaths. The most common grade 3 or higher adverse events were neutropenia (100%), thrombocytopenia (40%) and anemia (13.3%), all of which were reversible with supportive care. By week 12, 12 of 15 patients (80%) fulfilled both the LLDAS and DORIS remission criteria. Multiomic analyses confirmed elimination of autoreactive CD19⁺BCMA⁺ clones, reconstitution of naive IgM/IgD B cells and durable downregulation of interferon-stimulated and BAFF-dependent signatures, indicating improved immune homeostasis. Longitudinal monitoring of three patients for 1 year demonstrated sustained eradication of pathogenic clones, suggesting potential cure. Dual anti-CD19/anti-BCMA CAR-T cell therapy demonstrates good safety and promising clinical efficacy in treatment-refractory SLE. This study supports the further development of this treatment approach for patients with rSLE. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT05030779 .	Nature medicine	2025 Sep 24

10.1186/s12951-025-03698-z	Injectable responsive hydrogel with synergistic antibacterial and	Li X, Zhang Z, Yang X, Yu M, Tang Y, Wei J, Li Z, Hai J, Zhang B	Periodontitis is a chronic inflammatory disease driven by dysbiotic microbial biofilms and localized reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation, with inflammation management made challenging by recurrent infections from residual pathogenic bacteria in the periodontal pockets. To address this, we engineered an injectable pH-responsive hydrogel (MH@ZIF-8/CS/β-GP) through the integration of minocycline hydrochloride (MH)-encapsulated zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8) nanoparticles into a chitosan (CS) and β-glycerophosphate (β-GP) crosslinked matrix. The MH@ZIF-8 displayed broad-spectrum antimicrobial efficacy against key periodontal pathogens including Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg), and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (Aa), primarily attributed to the synergistic antimicrobial effects of Zn ions and MH. Additionally, MH@ZIF-8 effectively eliminated ROS by inhibiting the NLRP3/Caspase-1/IL-1β signaling pathway, demonstrating potent anti-inflammatory effect in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated RAW264.7 cells. The MH@ZIF-8/CS/β-GP hydrogel, which exhibited favored cytocompatibility with human gingival fibroblasts (HGFs), undergoed a rapid sol-gel transition and pH-responsive sustained-release drug delivery under the acidic conditions of periodontal pockets, effectively responding to periodontitis microenvironment. Meanwhile, this hydrogel effectively alleviated alveolar bone loss in vivo. Overall, the developed MH@ZIF-8/CS/β-GP hydrogel presents a novel strategy for chronic periodontitis treatment and demonstrates promising clinical application potential.

10.3310/DWKT1327	Effectiveness of surgical interventions in patients with severe pressure ulcers:	Reeves B, Pufulete M, Harris J, Dumville J, Adderley U, Burton A, Burton M, Atkinson R, Clout M, Cullum N, O'Connell A, O'Connor L, Palmer S, Ridd M, Rodrigues J, Wong J	BACKGROUND: Surgical reconstruction to close a severe pressure ulcer has not been evaluated. AIM AND OBJECTIVES: We aimed to investigate the feasibility of research to evaluate surgical reconstruction for severe pressure ulcers by: systematically reviewing evidence about: the effectiveness of surgical reconstruction for severe pressure ulcers; the impact of pressure ulceration on health-related quality-of-life (review 2) surveying primary and secondary care healthcare professionals about surgical referrals of patients with severe pressure ulcers and severe pressure ulcer management, including surgical reconstruction describing patients with incident pressure ulcers and with severe pressure ulcers having surgical reconstruction comparing outcomes in patients with severe pressure ulcers having/not having surgical reconstruction seeking consensus about treatments and management strategies for severe pressure ulcers. DESIGN: Systematic reviews; surveys; binary choice experiment; retrospective cohort studies using routine data; consensus meeting. PARTICIPANTS: General practitioners; nurses; and surgeons managing pressure ulcers; people with incident pressure ulcers and hospitalised with severe pressure ulcers. INTERVENTION: Surgical reconstruction. COMPARATOR: No surgical reconstruction. OUTCOMES: Surgical reconstruction, time to next admission with a severe pressure ulcer time to next admission, hospital stay, all-cause mortality, surgical reconstruction after discharge. RESULTS: Review 1 included three studies comparing different surgical reconstruction techniques. None reported wound-free time. Recurrence occurred in ≈ 20%. Review 2 included three randomised controlled trials measuring health-related quality of life, but none observed benefits of interventions evaluated. Among primary care survey respondents, 54% did not know surgical reconstruction can treat severe pressure ulcers; > 50% had never referred a patient to a surgeon. Among nurses, 72% had considered surgical reconstruction for a severe pressure ulcer; 54% believed surgical reconstruction should be more available. Among surgeons, 39% had never offered surgical reconstruction and 52% offered surgical reconstruction to < 50%; 68% believed surgical reconstruction should be more available. Routine data recorded 367,884 admissions with severe pressure ulcer diagnoses in England over 7.5 years; surgical reconstructions were performed in at least 404 and at most 1018 admissions. Twenty English hospitals performed > 70% of the surgical reconstructions. Comparing surgical reconstruction (n = 325) versus no surgical reconstruction (n = 1474) patients, time to next admission with a severe pressure ulcer was longer in patients having surgical reconstruction (hazard ratio = 0.79, 95% confidence interval 0.61 to 1.03; p = 0.07). Estimated pressure ulcer incidence in primary care was ≈ 5/10,000, but the true incidence was believed to be ≈ 7 times higher. Episodes of pressure ulcer care could not be identified. There was consensus about a referral pathway for severe pressure ulcer patients wanting surgical reconstruction, including both community-led and surgically led multidisciplinary team meetings, and about the influence of several patient and severe pressure ulcer characteristics on suitability for surgical reconstruction. LIMITATIONS: Surveys only considered factors one by one. Analyses of the Hospital Episode Statistics cohort depended on coding accuracy. For the comparison of surgical reconstruction and no surgical reconstruction, the no surgical reconstruction group had to be admitted. Routine data do not record wound healing outcomes. Primary care data underestimated pressure ulcer incidence; pressure ulcer care episodes could not be identified. The consensus meeting did not include surgeons. The COVID-19 pandemic caused delays, made team members unavailable and restricted face-to-face meetings. CONCLUSIONS: There is insufficient evidence to determine the effectiveness of surgical reconstruction on health-related quality of life or wound healing for severe pressure ulcers. Too few procedures are carried out to enable a randomised controlled trial to be feasible. FUTURE WORK: We identified three areas: qualitative research on the acceptability of surgical reconstruction and the impact of a SPU on a patient's quality-of-life; a core outcome set for interventions to treat pressure ulcers; and economic modelling of surgical reconstruction cost-effectiveness. STUDY REGISTRATION: This study is registered as PROSPERO 2019 CRD42019156436, 2019 CRD42019156450; ISRCTN13292620.

10.1016/j.clcc.2016.02.004	A Plasma-Based Protein Marker Panel for Colorectal Cancer Detection Identified by	Jones JJ, Wilcox BE, Benz RW, Babbar N, Boragine G, Burrell T, Christie EB, Croner LJ, Cun P, Dillon R, Kairs SN, Kao A, Preston R, Schreckengaust SR, Skor H, Smith WF, You J, Hillis WD, Agus DB, Blume JE	INTRODUCTION: Colorectal cancer (CRC) testing programs reduce mortality; however, approximately 40% of the recommended population who should undergo CRC testing does not. Early colon cancer detection in patient populations ineligible for testing, such as the elderly or those with significant comorbidities, could have clinical benefit. Despite many attempts to identify individual protein markers of this disease, little progress has been made. Targeted mass spectrometry, using multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) technology, enables the simultaneous assessment of groups of candidates for improved detection performance. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A multiplex assay was developed for 187 candidate marker proteins, using 337 peptides monitored through 674 simultaneously measured MRM transitions in a 30-minute liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of immunodepleted blood plasma. To evaluate the combined candidate marker performance, the present study used 274 individual patient blood plasma samples, 137 with biopsy-confirmed colorectal cancer and 137 age- and gender-matched controls. Using 2 well-matched platforms running 5 days each week, all 274 samples were analyzed in 52 days. RESULTS: Using one half of the data as a discovery set (69 disease cases and 69 control cases), the elastic net feature selection and random forest classifier assembly were used in cross-validation to identify a 15-transition classifier. The mean training receiver operating characteristic area under the curve was 0.82. After final classifier assembly using the entire discovery set, the 136-sample (68 disease cases and 68 control cases) validation set was evaluated. The validation area under the curve was 0.91. At the point of maximum accuracy (84%), the sensitivity was 87% and the specificity was 81%. CONCLUSION: These results have demonstrated the ability of simultaneous assessment of candidate marker proteins using high-multiplex, targeted-mass spectrometry to identify a subset group of CRC markers with significant and meaningful performance.

10.1007/s00432-025-06336-1	Management of hepatotoxicity associated with CDK4/6 inhibitors and rechallenge	İlhan N, Baş S, Alkan O, Doğan A, Majidova N, Tunç MA, Erdemoğlu E, Öztosun B, Ökten İN, Gümüş M	BACKGROUND: Cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 (CDK4/6) inhibitors combined with endocrine therapy have significantly improved clinical outcomes in patients with hormone receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HR + /HER2-) metastatic breast cancer. Hepatotoxicity is a known class-related adverse event that may interrupt or modify treatment. However, real-world evidence on its incidence, risk factors, and management strategies-particularly rechallenge approaches-remains limited. This study aimed to evaluate the frequency and clinical characteristics of CDK4/6 inhibitor-associated hepatotoxicity, to identify risk factors, and to assess the outcomes and safety of rechallenge following liver injury. METHODS: This retrospective multicenter study included 544 patients with HR+ /HER2- metastatic breast cancer who were treated with ribociclib or palbociclib between January 2017 and July 2024 in oncology centers across Turkey. Abemaciclib was not included due to reimbursement limitations during the study period. Patient characteristics, comorbidities, concomitant medications, and herbal or dietary supplement use were recorded. Liver function tests and viral hepatitis serologies were analyzed. Hepatotoxicity was graded using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v5.0), and causality was assessed with the Roussel Uclaf Causality Assessment Method (RUCAM). Management strategies-including dose interruption, dose reduction, switching to another CDK4/6 inhibitor, and outcomes of rechallenge were evaluated. RESULTS: Hepatotoxicity occurred in 10.5% of patients, most commonly in a hepatocellular pattern. Ribociclib was the most frequently used agent. Younger age, herbal supplement use, and hepatitis B carrier status were significantly associated with increased risk of hepatotoxicity. All hepatotoxic events were managed conservatively. None of the patients developed acute liver failure or required invasive evaluation. Dose reduction or switching to the alternate agent was attempted in most patients after enzyme normalization and was successful in the majority, with no recurrence of severe hepatotoxicity. CONCLUSION: CDK4/6 inhibitor-related hepatotoxicity is manageable with careful monitoring and individualized strategies. Timely dose interruption, switching agents, or cautious rechallenge allowed most patients to resume therapy safely. These findings support the continued use of CDK4/6 inhibitors in eligible patients, even after hepatotoxicity events.	Journal of cancer research and clinical oncology	2025 Sep 27

Peritumoral inflammation is typically viewed as a reaction to nearby tumor growth. Here, we report that the inflamed pancreatic lobules are frequently invaded by tumor cells, forming a distinct, non-fibrotic tumor niche. Using a semi-supervised machine learning approach for annotations of clinical samples and multiplex protein profiling, we show that tumor cells at the invasion front are closely associated with acinar cells undergoing damage-induced changes, and with activated fibroblasts expressing markers of injury. The invaded lobules are linked to classical tumor phenotypes, in contrast to fibrotic areas where tumor cells display a more basal profile, highlighting microenvironment-dependent tumor subtype differences. In female mice, lobular invasion similarly aligns with the classical tumor phenotype. Together, our data reveal that pancreatic tumors colonize injured lobules, creating a unique niche that shapes tumor characteristics and contributes to disease biology.

10.1038/s41467-025-63429-8	Aging in mice alters regionally enriched striatal astrocytes.	Linker KE, Duran-Laforet V, Ollivier M, Yu X, Schafer DP, Khakh BS	Aging affects multiple organs and within the brain drives distinct molecular changes across different cell types. The striatum encodes motor behaviors that decline with age, but our understanding of how cells within the striatum change remains incomplete. Using single-cell RNA sequencing from young and aged mice we identify molecularly distinct astrocyte subtypes. We show that astrocytes change significantly with age, exhibiting downregulation of genes, reduced diversity, and a shift to more homogenous inflammatory transcriptomic profiles. By exploring where striatal astrocyte subtypes are located with single-cell resolution, we map astrocytes enriched in dorsal, medial, and ventral striatum. Age increases inflammatory marker transcripts in dorsal striatal astrocytes, which display greater age-related changes than ventral striatal astrocytes. We impute molecular interactions between astrocytes and neurons and find that age particularly reduced interactions related to Nrxn2. Our data show that aging alters regionally enriched striatal astrocytes asymmetrically, with dorsal striatal astrocytes exhibiting greater age-related molecular changes.

10.1002/bcp.70296	Prescription use of acetaminophen among pregnant women in Denmark from 2000 to	Gram EB, Bliddal M, Pflugfelder S, Jensen PB, Damkier P	AIMS: The aim of this study was to describe prescription use of acetaminophen, a widely used analgesic and antipyretic generally considered safe during pregnancy, among pregnant women from 2000 to 2023 in Denmark with special attention towards variations following the change in over-the-counter (OTC) availability in 2013. METHODS: In this population-based drug utilization study, individually linked data from nationwide health registries on pregnant women in Denmark between 2000 and 2023 were used to evaluate time trends on prescription use of acetaminophen and describe distributions of maternal characteristics among prescription-based drug users and non-users. RESULTS: Among 1 446 841 eligible pregnancies included, 27 per 1000 pregnant women redeemed at least one prescription for acetaminophen during pregnancy, and among these, 18% redeemed more than one. In 2023, 74 per 1000 pregnancies were exposed to prescription use of acetaminophen. Relative to non-users, prescription-based drug users were generally older and had a higher body mass index. They more frequently presented with pain-related, chronic or psychiatric conditions and used other prescription medications throughout the study period. However, these differences were less pronounced in the cohort restricted to pregnancies ending in 2015-2023 compared to 2000-2012. CONCLUSIONS: Prescription use of acetaminophen in the pregnant population in Denmark has increased since 2000, with a notable sharp increase from 2013 onwards, coinciding with the regulatory restriction that reduced over-the-counter pack sizes, alongside a concurrent rise in general-population prescription use. Prescription-based drug users were more likely to have comorbidities and multiple medication use than non-users, although these differences have become less pronounced in recent years.

10.1038/s41598-021-82296-z	Predicting the probability of Gaucher disease in subjects with splenomegaly and	Motta I, Consonni D, Stroppiano M, Benedetto C, Cassinerio E, Tappino B, Ranalli P, Borin L, Facchini L, Patriarca A, Barcellini W, Lanza F, Filocamo M, Cappellini MD	Hematologists are frequently involved in the diagnostic pathway of Gaucher disease type 1 (GD1) patients since they present several hematological signs. However, GD1 is mainly underdiagnosed because of a lack of awareness. In this multicenter study, we combine the use of a diagnostic algorithm with a simple test (β-glucosidase activity on Dried Blood Spot) in order to facilitate the diagnosis in a population presenting to the hematologist with splenomegaly and/or thrombocytopenia associated with other hematological signs. In this high-risk population, the prevalence of GD1 is 3.3%. We propose an equation that predicts the probability of having GD1 according to three parameters that are routinely evaluated: platelet count, ferritin, and transferrin saturation.

10.1002/ptr.70100	Hesperidin Inhibits Oxidative Stress and Apoptosis of Granulosa Cells in	Zhang Q, Yang Z, Ou X, Zhang M, Ji R, Wu G	Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrine-metabolic disorder syndrome in women of childbearing age. Hesperidin (HES), a phytoflavonoid glycoside found in citrus fruits such as oranges and lemons, has a variety of pharmacological effects. HES has been extensively studied to protect a variety of tissues from oxidative damage. However, it is not known whether HES may have a therapeutic effect on PCOS. In this study, potential therapeutic targets for HES treatment of PCOS were identified through network pharmacology, altered phosphorylation modification of JAK2 and PI3K was verified in granular cells of PCOS patients, and the mechanism of HES treatment of PCOS was revealed through in vivo and in vitro experiments. Based on network-based pharmacological studies, PI3K/Akt and JAK2/STAT3 pathways are potential pathways for HES treatment of PCOS, and molecular docking results show that JAK2 has the best binding activity with HES. Western blotting results showed that the phosphorylation modification of JAK2 and PI3K in granular cells of PCOS patients was changed. Experiments in KGN cell lines have shown that HES can reduce DHT-induced oxidative stress and apoptotic damage. Activating JAK2 or inhibiting PI3K can both reverse this therapeutic effect. In vivo experiments have shown similar results. HES affects oxidative stress and apoptosis in PCOS through signaling crosstalk between JAK2/STAT3 and PI3K/AKT pathways.

10.1186/s13287-025-04638-2	Efficacy and safety of single versus repeated injections of mesenchymal stem	Deng L, Zhao C, Zhou L, Mu X, Sun H, Li L, Zhang Y	BACKGROUND: In recent years, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been widely applied in the clinical treatment of knee osteoarthritis (KOA), demonstrating promising therapeutic efficacy. However, intervention protocols for MSCs have not yet been standardized, and evidence regarding the impact of different injection frequencies on the efficacy and safety of MSC treatment in KOA remains limited. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to integrate evidence from conventional and network meta-analyses to evaluate the efficacy and safety of different intervention frequencies (single vs. repeated MSC injections) in the treatment of knee osteoarthritis (KOA). METHODS: A systematic search was conducted in PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and Web of Science databases up to March 1, 2025. Traditional meta-analysis was performed to assess the efficacy and safety of MSC therapy for KOA, followed by a network meta-analysis (NMA) to evaluate the effectiveness of single versus repeated MSC injections. Outcome measures included WOMAC and VAS scores at 3, 6, and 12 months, as well as the incidence of adverse events (AEs). Traditional meta-analysis and NMA were conducted using Review Manager 5.3 and Stata SE16.0, respectively. RESULTS: A total of 16 RCTs involving 622 patients were included. Traditional meta-analysis showed that MSC therapy significantly improved pain and knee joint function in KOA patients at different time points (3, 6, and 12 months). The results of the network meta-analysis (NMA) indicated that, compared to single MSC injections, repeated MSC injections provided greater improvements in pain and functional scores at 6 and 12 months, demonstrating superior efficacy. However, repeated MSC injections were also associated with a higher incidence of adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: Both single and repeated MSC injections could improve pain and knee joint function in patients with KOA. Compared to single injections, repeated MSC injections may offer superior therapeutic benefits; however, they are associated with a higher incidence of adverse events. In clinical practice, potential side effects of repeated MSC administration must be carefully considered. Future research should focus on large-scale, multicenter, and long-term randomized controlled trials to further validate the efficacy and safety of MSC therapy for KOA.

10.1136/gutjnl-2025-335642	Alleviated T cell exhaustion and SLC1A3-mediated stroma-remodelling dictate	Xiang S, Chen Y, Wang C, Wang M, He Y, Liu Z, Zhang JL, Yang LP, Wei YF, Wu QN, Wang ZX, Xi SY, Li Z, Zhao Q, Xu RH, Wang F	BACKGROUND: Combining chemotherapy with anti-programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) improves clinical outcomes in oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), yet the underlying synergistic mechanism remains obscured. Moreover, 30-50% of patients still derive no therapeutic benefit from the combination strategy, highlighting the need to decipher and overcome resistance. OBJECTIVE: We sought to investigate the mechanisms by which chemotherapy augments the responses to immune checkpoint blockade and elucidate the factors contributing to persistent resistance in non-responding patients. DESIGN: We designed a systematic investigation involving longitudinal sampling of ESCC tissues both from patients treated with chemotherapy plus anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-1 monotherapy. The tumour microenvironment (TME) was then comprehensively characterised using single-cell transcriptomics, T cell receptor repertoire analysis, multiplex immunohistochemistry and murine models. RESULTS: We demonstrated that combination therapy exerted superior antitumour efficacy by mitigating immune checkpoint engagements (TIGIT-NECTIN2 and NECTIN1-CD96) between epithelial-stress tumour cells and CD8(+) T cells, thereby preventing T cells from exhaustion and boosting vitality. In non-responders, we identified a subset of tumour cells with high SLC1A3 expression, which localised at the tumour boundary and interacted with COL1A1(+) myofibroblastic cancer-associated fibroblasts, inducing an extracellular matrix-enriched TME that hindered the infiltration of CD8(+) T cells. Inhibiting SLC1A3 significantly enhanced the efficacy of chemotherapy plus anti-PD-1, underscoring its potential as a therapeutic target. CONCLUSION: This study elucidates the synergistic mechanisms and identifies key resistance pathways underlying chemo-immunotherapy combinations in patients with ESCC, providing a scientific basis for refining future combination therapeutic regimens.

10.3390/nu17183002	Omega-3 Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids and Cognitive Decline in Adults with	Barros MI, Brandão T, Irving SC, Alves P, Gomes F, Correia M	BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: As global aging accelerates, prevalence of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) continues to rise, challenging healthcare systems and diminishing older adults' quality of life. There is great interest in better understanding the neuroprotective/anti-inflammatory properties of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids but the results from many published studies in humans come to different conclusions. This review aims to clarify the efficacy of n-3 fatty acids as a preventive or therapeutic strategy for cognitive health and to inform future clinical recommendations within aging populations. METHODS: Following PRISMA guidelines and a registered PROSPERO protocol, we reviewed systematic reviews (SRs) from 2014 to 2024 assessing exclusive n-3 fatty acid supplementation and cognitive outcomes via MMSE. Data were extracted on intervention details and cognitive scores. Meta-analyses used fixed and random-effects models, with Hedges' estimating overall impact. Quality was assessed using AMSTAR-2, and statistical analyses were performed (SPSS 28). RESULTS: A total of nine SRs incorporating 14 RCTs were included, representing 26,881 participants aged 40 years or older. The pooled random-effects meta-analysis showed a statistically significant but modest improvement in MMSE scores (effect size: 0.16; 95% CI: 0.01-0.32). Heterogeneity was moderate (I(2) = 42.8%), and no publication bias was detected. Further analyses revealed no significant associations between treatment duration or dosage and cognitive outcomes, suggesting a threshold effect rather than a dose-response relationship. CONCLUSIONS: These findings support n3-PUFA supplementation as a complementary approach to lifestyle-based strategies for cognitive health, including diet, physical activity, sleep optimization, and cognitive training. While benefits appear modest, consistent effects across studies warrant further high-quality research and well-designed studies to strengthen clinical recommendations.	Nutrients	2025 Sep 19
10.1212/WNL.0000000000214177	Screening for Congenital Myasthenic Syndromes in Adults With Seronegative	Krenn M, Wagner M, Schuller H, Pugna I, Rath J, Zulehner G, Keritam O, Weng R, Koneczny I, Schiavo E, Damato V, Kleinveld VEA, Kiss C, Gold V, Quasthoff S, Masi G, O'Connor KC, Canning J, Waters PJ, Lenz D, Blüthner M, Pavlov M, Graf E, Winkelmann J, Löscher WN, Zimprich F, Cetin H	BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Myasthenia gravis (MG) is a disorder of the neuromuscular junction, typically associated with autoantibodies (Abs) that impair neuromuscular transmission. However, approximately 10% of cases are seronegative. Emerging evidence suggests that seronegative MG (SNMG) may be mimicked by hereditary conditions, particularly congenital myasthenic syndromes (CMSs), which require different treatments. In this study, we aimed to determine the proportion of CMS among patients diagnosed with SNMG. METHODS: We used whole-exome sequencing (WES) in adult patients (aged ≥18 years) diagnosed with SNMG who were enrolled at 3 Austrian tertiary neuromuscular centers between August 2022 and January 2024. Genetic testing was conducted in individuals who remained seronegative after comprehensive serologic testing to exclude Abs against (clustered) acetylcholine receptors, muscle-specific kinase, lipoprotein receptor-related protein 4, and voltage-gated calcium channels. Moreover, we aimed to analyze clinical and demographic factors associated with the likelihood of receiving a molecular diagnosis. RESULTS: A total of 50 patients with SNMG (35 [70%] female) were referred for exome-based genetic screening. The median age at disease onset was 35 years (interquartile range 24.0-46.0 years). Seven patients (14%) were genetically diagnosed with CMS through WES (4 with CHRNE and 3 with RAPSN variants). In addition, findings of uncertain clinical significance were reported in 4 cases, implicating CACNA1S, DOK7, DPAGT1, and RAPSN. Although patients with CMS tended to have a younger age at disease onset in univariate analysis (p = 0.04, r = 0.29), no clinical or demographic factors remained significantly associated with a molecular diagnosis after correction for multiple testing. Only 1 patient with a confirmed CMS diagnosis reported a positive family history. Six individuals with CMS (86%) had either received immunomodulatory treatments (n = 4) or undergone thymectomy (n = 4). Of the 4 patients with CMS receiving immunotherapies, 3 were reported to have experienced at least a partial response. DISCUSSION: Our findings provide evidence that a considerable proportion of patients diagnosed with SNMG have an underlying hereditary etiology. Notably, a (subjective) response to immunotherapies does not exclude a molecular CMS diagnosis. In conclusion, offering genetic testing to seronegative patients with myasthenic syndromes may have profound therapeutic implications.	Neurology	2025 Oct 21

Purpose: to evaluate the prevalence and location of assaults against nursing personnel in Latin America, and to determine predictor factors for aggression against nurses. (2) Methods: A cross-sectional online survey was answered by 374 nurses working in health care during the COVID-19 pandemic. The aggression against nurses was estimated using the Victimization Scale. (3) Results: A total of 288 nurses were included in this study. The victimization scale showed that 52.1% of nurses have suffered aggression by the general population during the COVID-19 pandemic. Males were more likely to be attacked than females (p < 0.05). Additionally, males were attacked more frequently on public transport (x(2) = 6.72, p = 0.01). The home neighborhood and markets were other locations with a higher risk of being assaulted (OR: 3.39, CI: 1.53-7.50). (4) Conclusions: Our results indicate that nurses in Latin America who work during the COVID-19 pandemic and social isolation have been frequently assaulted by the general public. Males are more frequently attacked than females and the main places of aggression are public transportation, their home neighborhood and supermarkets. Implications for nursing practice: it is necessary to create and implement protocols and guidelines to support nursing personnel during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study was retrospectively registered at the Juarez Autonomous University of Tabasco (103/CIPDACS/2020) on the (08/2020).	Nursing reports (Pavia, Italy)	2023 Oct 7
10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2025.147928	Autophagic damage in senescent bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells: Impact on	Huang C, Chen X, Wu D, Chen J, Wang J, Li S, Hu J, Yan Z, Zhu Y, Zhang Y	Osteoporosis is a major health challenge, particularly in postmenopausal women. Bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells (BMSCs) are crucial for maintaining bone homeostasis by differentiating into osteoblasts and adipocytes. However, in the osteoporotic microenvironment, aging and estrogen deficiency lead to oxidative stress, impairing BMSC function and promoting senescence. Piezo1, a mechanosensitive calcium-permeable ion channel highly expressed in BMSCs, translates mechanical cues into pro-osteogenic signals. This study aimed to investigate the interplay between autophagy, Piezo1 expression, and BMSC senescence in osteoporosis, and explore the therapeutic potential of modulating the autophagy-Piezo1 axis. We observed that Piezo1 expression was downregulated in the bone tissues of patients with osteoporosis and ovariectomized (OVX) mice, accompanied by an increase in senescence-associated markers in BMSCs. Oxidative stress reduced Piezo1 expression and promoted BMSC senescence, shifting differentiation toward adipogenic rather than osteogenic lineages. Autophagic flux was impaired in senescent BMSCs, and activating autophagy via rapamycin restored Piezo1 expression, alleviated senescence, and rebalanced osteogenic/adipogenic differentiation. Mechanistically, inhibiting the mTOR/S6K pathway enhanced autophagy and Piezo1 expression. Rapamycin treatment increased bone mass and improved bone microarchitecture in OVX mice by promoting Piezo1 expression and suppressing senescence markers. Our findings highlight the critical role of autophagy in maintaining Piezo1 expression and BMSC function, suggesting that targeting the autophagy-Piezo1 axis may offer a novel therapeutic strategy for osteoporosis management.

10.1186/s13287-025-04617-7	hPDLSC-ApoEVs attenuate periodontitis and enhance bone regeneration via	Zhang Z, Zeng L, Yu Y, Xu Z, Zhu G, Weng J, Xia J, Peng W, Dong Q, Li Y, Zhang L, Liang L, Pathak JL, Yu L	BACKGROUND: Periodontitis is the most prevalent oral disease worldwide, leading to inflammation, alveolar bone loss, and tooth loss. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) transplantation has the potential to alleviate periodontitis and restore alveolar bone, but numerous studies have found that transplanted MSCs undergo apoptosis, releasing apoptotic extracellular vesicles (ApoEVs). Human periodontal ligament stem cells (hPDLSCs) ApoEVs have immunomodulatory and tissue regenerative potential. Still, their role in periodontitis treatment and alveolar bone restoration has not been investigated yet. METHODS: The study isolated hPDLSCs-ApoEVs and investigated the modulatory effect on macrophaghe. We explored the specific molecular mechanisms of hPDLSC-ApoEVs in regulating macrophage polarization in vitro through mRNA-seq and inhibitors. Co-culture experiment demonstrated that hPDLSC-ApoEVs promoted hPDLSC osteogenic differentiation by regulating macrophage polarization.

10.1186/s13287-025-04642-6	A traditional herbal decoction regulates skeletal muscle satellite cell	Jin Z, Da W, Shen Y, Zhao Y, Xu H, Wan H, Wu X, Gao X, Li Y, Shi Q, Tang D	INTRODUCTION: Osteosarcopenic fractures, an emerging geriatric syndrome characterized by sarcopenia-osteoporotic fractures coexistence, delayed fracture healing, and elevated risk of re-fracture. Limited research has investigated the mechanisms by which skeletal muscle satellite cells (SMSCs) promote muscle regeneration and osteoporotic fracture healing. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of a traditional herbal decoction (HD), the Invigorate the Spleen and Tonify the Kidney Formula, on SMSC regulation, muscle regeneration, and fracture healing. METHOD: Using conditional knockout mice, the role of SMSCs in promoting fracture healing and mitigating sarcopenia was evaluated by visualizing the fracture area and surrounding muscle tissue. The signaling pathways involved were comprehensively analyzed using a combination of Western blotting, real-time PCR analysis, immunohistochemical staining, and immunofluorescent staining. And the key elements and compounds facilitating osteogenesis and myogenesis were identified using HPLC and network pharmacology analysis. RESULTS: This study demonstrated that the herbal decoction mediates the β-catenin signaling pathway, mobilizes SMSCs to migrate to the fracture area, facilitates their osteogenic and myogenic differentiation, and enhances osteoporotic fracture healing. Knockdown of β-catenin in SMSCs in Pax7-Cre(ERT2/+);β-catenin(fx/fx) conditional knockout mice led to sarcopenia and osteoporosis. Additionally, the herbal decoction significantly increased bone mass, repaired bone microstructure, and promoted muscle fiber remodeling around fractures in mice. CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide the first evidence that the HD, as a β-catenin agonist, not only promotes fracture healing by modulating the osteogenic and myogenic effects of SMSCs but also ameliorates sarcopenia. This study offers practical evidence supporting the formula as a promising therapeutic candidate for treating osteosarcopenic fractures.	Stem cell research & therapy	2025 Sep 26
10.1038/s41418-025-01587-4	AARS1-mediated lactylation of H3K18 and STAT1 promotes ferroptosis in diabetic	Hong J, Xu H, Yu L, Yu Z, Chen X, Meng Z, Zhu J, Li J, Zhu M	Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is the primary cause of end-stage renal disease worldwide. Recent studies have revealed that lactate-mediated histone lactylation, which functions as a novel epigenetic modification, is involved in the occurrence and development of diabetes-related complications. However, little is known about the role of lactyltransferase in DN. Alanyl-tRNA synthetase 1 (AARS1) was identified as a novel lactyltransferase that modulates histone H3-lysine-18 lactylation (H3K18la). In the present study, we determined whether AARS1-mediated H3K18la participates in the pathogenesis of DN. More importantly, we explored the potential mechanism involved. A mouse DN model consisting of both wild-type and alanyl-tRNA synthetase (AARS1) heterozygote (AARS1(+/-)) mice was utilized in this study. Transcriptomic and lipidomic analyses, combined with a variety of molecular biological methodologies, were employed to elucidate the potential mechanism by which AARS1 regulates ferroptosis in DN. Our results indicated that the increases in AARS1 and H3K18la expression were involved in kidney dysfunction and renal cell death via the modulation of ferroptosis in the DN model. Moreover, AARS1 induced lipid peroxidation by increasing fatty acid elongase-5 (ELOVL5) transcription, ultimately contributing to ferroptosis induction. Furthermore, AARS1 interacted with signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) to jointly regulate ELOVL5 transcription. Additionally, treatment with the STAT1-specific inhibitor fludarabine delayed DN progression. In addition, we observed that AARS1 modulated the lactylation of both STAT1 and H3K18 to regulate ELOVL5 transcription, thus triggering ferroptosis. Inhibition of AARS1-induced lactylation via β-alanine attenuated ferroptosis in DN model mice and hyperglycaemic cells. The present study showed that AARS1 induced the lactylation of H3K18 and STAT1 to regulate ELOVL5 transcription, thus triggering ferroptosis in a diabetic nephropathy model.

In this study, we quantitatively profiled serum metabolites of participants in 2 independent cohorts. Based on the data from cohort 1 (22 AD patients, 19 MCI patients and 19 cognitively normal participants (CN)), we identified 32 differential metabolites in AD and 49 in MCI serum. Notably, differential metabolites related to amino acid (AA), organic acid, fatty acid (FA), phosphatidylcholine (PC), sphingomyelin (SM) metabolism in AD and free fatty acid (FFA), acylcarnitine, PC, SM in MCI were strongly associated with cognitive level, memory, attention and execution function as evaluated by cognitive scales. Pathway analysis based on the differential metabolites revealed perturbation in pathways related to phospholipid metabolism, sphingolipid metabolism, AAs metabolism, beta oxidation of FAs, and carnitine metabolism. Using random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM) and Boruta analysis for classification and validated by gradient boosting (GB), logistic regression (LR) and RF diagnostic model, we identified panels of 10 metabolites in AD and 13 metabolites in MCI that effectively discriminate AD and MCI individuals from CN with high accuracy, sensitivity and specificity. The diagnostic accuracy of the models was further validated in an independent cohort 2, consisting of 20 AD, 20 MCI and 20 CN individuals, with consistent results.

A long-standing hypothesis is that timely resolution of G4s is needed for efficient and faithful DNA replication. In vitro, G4s may be unwound by helicases or alternatively resolved via DNA2 nuclease mediated G4 cleavage. However, little is known about the biological significance and regulatory mechanism of the DNA2-mediated G4 removal pathway. Here, we report that DNA2 deficiency or its chemical inhibition leads to a significant accumulation of G4s and stalled replication forks at telomeres, which is demonstrated by a high-resolution technology: Single molecular analysis of replicating DNA (SMARD). We further identify that the DNA repair complex MutSα (MSH2-MSH6) binds G4s and stimulates G4 resolution via DNA2-mediated G4 excision. MSH2 deficiency, like DNA2 deficiency or inhibition, causes G4 accumulation and defective telomere replication. Meanwhile, G4-stabilizing environmental compounds block G4 unwinding by helicases but not G4 cleavage by DNA2. Consequently, G4 stabilizers impair telomere replication and cause telomere instabilities, especially in cells deficient in DNA2 or MSH2.	Nature communications	2025 Sep 26
10.1186/s13024-025-00889-y	A novel alpha-synuclein G14R missense variant is associated with atypical	Brücke C, Al-Azzani M, Ramalingam N, Ramón M, Sousa RL, Buratti F, Zech M, Sicking K, Amaral L, Gelpi E, Chandran A, Agarwal A, Chaves SR, Fernández CO, Dettmer U, Lautenschläger J, Zweckstetter M, Busnadiego RF, Zimprich A, Outeiro TF	BACKGROUND: Parkinson's disease (PD) affects millions of people worldwide, but only 5-10% of patients suffer from a monogenic forms of the disease with Mendelian inheritance. SNCA, the gene encoding for the protein alpha-synuclein (aSyn), was the first to be associated with familial forms of PD and, since then, several missense variants and multiplications of the gene have been established as rare causes of autosomal dominant forms of PD. In this study, we report the identification of a novel SNCA mutation in a patient that presented with a complex neurogenerative disorder, and unconventional neuropathological findings. We also performed in depth molecular studies of the effects of the novel aSyn mutation. METHODS: A patient carrying the novel aSyn missense mutation and the family members were studied. We present the clinical features, genetic testing-whole exome sequencing (WES), and neuropathological findings. The functional consequences of this aSyn variant were extensively investigated using biochemical, biophysical, and cellular assays. RESULTS: The patient exhibited a complex neurodegenerative disease that included generalized myocloni, bradykinesia, dystonia of the left arm and apraxia. WES identified a novel heterozygous SNCA variant (cDNA 40G > A; protein G14R). Neuropathological examination showed extensive atypical aSyn pathology with frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD)-type distribution and nigral degeneration pattern with abundant ring-like neuronal inclusions, and few oligodendroglial inclusions. Sanger sequencing confirmed the SNCA variant in one healthy, 86-year-old parent of the patient suggesting incomplete penetrance. NMR studies suggest that the G14R mutation induces a local structural alteration in aSyn, and lower thioflavin T binding in in vitro fibrillization assays. Interestingly, the G14R aSyn fibers display different fibrillar morphologies than Lewy bodies as revealed by cryo-electron microscopy. Cellular studies of the G14R variant revealed increased inclusion formation, enhanced membrane association, and impaired dynamic reversibility of serine-129 phosphorylation. CONCLUSIONS: The atypical neuropathological features observed, which are reminiscent of those observed for the G51D aSyn variant, suggest a causal role of the SNCA variant with a distinct clinical and pathological phenotype, which is further supported by the properties of the mutant aSyn.

10.1007/s00204-025-04206-w	cGAS-STING and autophagy: crosstalk, molecular mechanisms, and targeted therapy.	Wang Y, Wu S, Zhang X, Zheng W, Wang Z, Zhang J, Chen J, Wang H	The cytosolic DNA-sensing cGAS-STING pathway and autophagy represent two evolutionarily conserved systems critical for innate immunity and cellular homeostasis. The cGAS-STING pathway detects mislocalized DNA, triggering inflammation via interferon and cytokine production. Conversely, autophagy maintains equilibrium by degrading damaged organelles and pathogens. Crucially, these systems engage in reciprocal regulation: autophagy constrains cGAS-STING hyperactivity through lysosomal degradation of immunostimulatory DNA and STING itself, while cGAS-STING signaling induces autophagy via TBK1-mediated phosphorylation of autophagy adaptors to mitigate self-damage. Dysregulation of this interplay drives pathology. For instance, defective autophagy in systemic lupus erythematosus permits mitochondrial DNA accumulation and cGAS-driven interferonopathy, whereas persistent STING activation in cancers suppresses autophagic tumor surveillance. This review aims to dissect the molecular mechanisms underpinning their crosstalk, delineate its disruption in autoimmune, neurodegenerative, and oncological diseases, and critically evaluate emerging therapies designed to pharmacologically rebalance this axis. These include combining cGAS-STING inhibitors with autophagy enhancers to suppress inflammation in interferonopathies, and pairing STING agonists with autophagy inducers to potentiate antitumor immunity.By synthesizing preclinical and clinical advances, we establish a framework for developing context-specific therapeutics that exploit the cGAS-STING-autophagy circuit-translating mechanistic insights into precision treatments for immune dysregulation disorders.

10.1186/s13098-025-01949-5	Mediation of fasting blood glucose between relative muscle strength and	Wang P, Huang L, Zhu Z, Hu X, Wu B, Yang X	BACKGROUND: Hypertension and type 2 diabetes are major global health burdens and often coexist due to shared metabolic risk factors. Relative muscle strength (RMS), a composite measure of muscle function, shows an inverse association with hypertension. The mechanisms underlying this link remain unclear. Elevated fasting blood glucose (FBG) reflects impaired glucose metabolism and insulin resistance and is associated with both reduced muscle strength and higher blood pressure. This suggests that FBG may partly mediate the RMS-hypertension relationship. Yet, large-scale population studies have rarely tested this mediating pathway, leaving an important knowledge gap. METHODS: We analyzed data from two nationally representative cohorts: NHANES (2011-2014;adults aged ≥ 18 Years, mean age 48 years ) and CHARLS (2011-2012; adults aged ≥ 45 Years, mean age 58 years). Hypertension prevalence was nearly 30.0% in NHANES and 42.1% in CHARLS. RMS was calculated as grip strength divided by appendicular skeletal muscle mass (ASM). Hypertension was defined as systolic/diastolic blood pressure ≥ 140/90 mmHg or self-reported diagnosis. Logistic regression examined the RMS-hypertension associations, and causal mediation analysis quantified fasting glucose's mediating role, and restricted cubic spline models were applied to explore potential non-linear relationship. RESULTS: In NHANES (n = 9,652; Hypertension prevalence 30.0%), RMS was inversely associated with hypertension across quartiles (Q2-Q4 vs. Q1: adjusted ORs (95% CIs) of 0.82, 0.78, and 0.72, respectively). Mediation analysis showed fasting glucose partially mediated this association, accounting for 13.1% of this association. In CHARLS (n = 12,946; Hypertension prevalence 42.1%), similar trends were observed (Q2-Q4 vs. Q1: adjusted ORs (95% CIs) 0.91, 0.76, and 0.66), But fasting glucose partially mediated this association, explaining only 2.0% of the association. Restricted cubic spline models revealed significant nonlinearity in CHARLS (P < 0.001) but not in NHANES (P = 0.921). CONCLUSION: This study is the first to examine the partially mediating role of fasting blood glucose in the RMS-hypertension relationship across diverse populations. RMS was consistently associated with lower hypertension risk, with varying degrees of glucose mediation between cohorts. These findings support integrating RMS assessment into cardiovascular risk screening and highlight muscle strength as a potential target for non-pharmacological prevention. Given the cross-sectional nature of this study, longitudinal research is needed to clarify causal pathways and inform public health strategies.	Diabetology & metabolic syndrome	2025 Sep 26

PCD is associated with early-onset chronic wet cough and rhinosinusitis, laterality defects, middle ear disease, and reduced fertility. The clinical presentation is heterogeneous, and diagnosis often relies on multiple tests. The American Thoracic Society (ATS) and European Respiratory Society (ERS) have previously developed separate guidelines for diagnosis. Here, ERS and ATS members systematically reviewed the literature on diagnostic tools used in practice and developed unified evidence-based guidelines for PCD diagnosis using GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations) methodology, and a transparent process of decision-making using Evidence-to-Decision (EtD) frameworks. The Task Force panel formulated three PICO (Patients, Intervention, Comparison, Outcomes) questions and three narrative questions. The accuracies of high-speed video microscopy (HSVM), immunofluorescence (IF), and nasal nitric oxide (nNO) were compared to a reference test of transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and/or genetics. The panel gives strong recommendation for use of HSVM, IF, and nNO as adjunct tests to TEM and/or genetics for PCD diagnosis. However, no adjunct test is suitable as a standalone test to diagnose PCD and no single adjunct or reference test is suitable to exclude PCD. Pursuing a genetic diagnosis is encouraged due to the implication on management. The panel emphasizes that tests should meet a minimum standard and proposes evaluation of patients at a referral centre experienced in diagnosis. The pretest probability based on symptoms should be considered when interpreting results.	The European respiratory journal	2025 Sep 26
10.1016/j.kint.2025.08.030	Critical role of transcription factor SOX4 in tubular epithelial cell	Du H, Jiao B, Xing J, Yang D, Tran M, Wang P, Hu Z, Lefebvre V, Zhou D, Wang Y	INTRODUCTION: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a widely prevalent health issue globally. A striking pathological feature of CKD is kidney fibrosis characterized by excessive production and deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM). Tubular epithelial cell (TEC) dedifferentiation and fibroblast activation contribute to the pathogenesis of kidney fibrosis. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying TEC dedifferentiation and fibroblast activation are not fully understood. Here, we investigated the role of SRY-box transcription factor 4 (SOX4) in regulating TEC dedifferentiation and fibroblast activation during the development of CKD. METHODS: We generated global, TEC-specific, and fibroblast-specific SOX4 knockout mice. These mice were subjected to three preclinical models of kidney fibrosis induced by unilateral ureteral obstruction, ischemia-reperfusion injury, or high-dose folic acid to examine the role of SOX4 in TEC dedifferentiation and fibroblast activation during the development of kidney fibrosis. Cultured TECs and fibroblasts were employed to determine the role and molecular mechanisms of SOX4 in regulating TEC dedifferentiation and fibroblast activation in vitro. RESULTS: SOX4 was induced in the injured kidneys but its deficiency inhibits TEC dedifferentiation, fibroblast activation and further impeded the development of kidney fibrosis in mice. In vitro, knockdown of SOX4 preserved the epithelial phenotype and inhibited fibroblast activation induced by transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1). Mechanistically, SOX4 facilitated the TGF-β1-Smad3 signaling pathway to promote TEC dedifferentiation and fibroblast activation. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings identify SOX4 as a critical factor in TEC dedifferentiation and fibroblast activation suggesting SOX4 may serve as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of CKD.

Sensitivity to ferroptosis is expected to vary in different organelles. To monitor in real time the onset and progression of lipid peroxidation in ferroptosis, here we report lipophilic fluorogenic radical-trapping antioxidants, embedding in endoplasmic reticulum, lysosomes, mitochondria and plasma membrane. We show that endoplasmic reticulum- and lysosome-embedding fluorogenic radical-trapping antioxidants are most effective in protecting from cell death. The onset of lipid peroxidation happens in the endoplasmic reticulum, with lipid hydroperoxide accumulating in Golgi-associated vesicles. Disintegration of these structures spreads lipid hydroperoxide intracellularly, acting as 'free radical embers'. Outwards migration of oxidized lipids to plasma membrane, the ultimate sink for oxidized lipids, was recorded. Our results underscore Golgi-associated structures as a site to regulate ferroptosis progression. The work further positions fluorogenic radical-trapping antioxidants as valuable tools for unravelling the dynamic subcellular progression of ferroptosis.	Nature chemistry	2025 Sep 26
10.1111/acel.70233	Age-Associated Transcriptomic and Epigenetic Alterations in Mouse Hippocampus.	Bilgic M, Obata R, Panfil VI, Zhu Z, Saeki M, Gotoh Y, Kishi Y	Aging represents a major risk for human neurodegenerative disorders, such as dementia and Alzheimer's disease, and is associated with a functional decline in neurons and impaired synaptic plasticity, leading to a gradual decline in memory. Previous research has identified molecular and functional changes associated with aging through transcriptomic studies and neuronal excitability measurements, while the role of chromatin-level regulation in vulnerability to aging-related diseases is not well understood. Moreover, the causal relationship between molecular alterations and aging-associated decline in functions of different cell types remains poorly understood. Here, we systematically characterized gene regulatory networks in a cell type-specific manner in the aging mouse hippocampus, a central brain region involved in learning and memory formation, by simultaneously profiling gene expression and chromatin accessibility at a single-nucleus level. The analysis of multiome (RNA and ATAC) sequencing recapitulated the diversity of glial and neuronal cell types in the hippocampus and revealed transcriptomic and chromatin accessibility level changes in different cell types, among which oligodendrocytes and dentate gyrus (DG) neurons exhibited the most drastic changes. We found pronounced aging-dependent chromatin-level changes among neurons, especially for genes related to synaptic plasticity. Our data suggest that BACH2, a candidate transcription factor implicated in aging-mediated functional decline of DG neurons, potentially regulates genes associated with synaptic plasticity, cell death, and inflammation during aging. Taken together, our single-nucleus multiome analysis reveals potential cell type-specific regulators involved in the aging of neurons and glial cells.	Aging cell	2025 Sep 28

The contribution of PNS-resident immune cells to these functions is not fully understood. We identified group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) as a distinct immune cell population resident in the PNS, with a unique gene profile facilitating neuron-ILC2 cross-talk. ILC2-deficient mice display PNS dysfunction (hypersensitivity and gait anomalies). These functional deficits are attributed to structural abnormalities in the sciatic nerves of ILC2-deficient mice. ILC2s communicate with dorsal root ganglion neurons via the interleukin-13 (IL-13) signaling pathway to maintain nerve structure and pain thresholds. Loss of the shared IL-4/IL-13 receptor (IL-4R/IL-13R) in neurons results in a phenotype similar to ILC2-deficient mice. Intrathecally administered IL-13 rescues hypersensitivity and gait defects in ILC2-deficient mice, which suggests that this signaling pathway may be therapeutically important. This work therefore identifies a function for ILC2s in regulating the nerve structural integrity and nociceptive functions of the PNS.	Science immunology	2025 Sep 26
10.1002/anie.202517917	Cleavable Antibody-Conjugated Aβ Specific Immune Exosome for Combination	Ma M, Wang J, Zhong W, Li Z, Zhao Y	Recent progress in antibody-based immunotherapies for Alzheimer's disease (AD) brings a sense of cautious optimism after years of setbacks. However, these approaches remain constrained by suboptimal pharmacodynamics, modest clinical benefits, and pro-inflammatory adverse effects. Here, we develop a β-secretase-responsive immunotherapeutic agent (ATExo-cL-aA) that synergistically targets amyloid-β (Aβ) and neuroinflammatory response, achieving heightened efficacy while reducing the side effects associated with conventional antibody therapies. After intranasal administration, ATExo-cL-aA actively migrates to AD brains. Upon cleavage by overexpressed β-secretase, ATExo-cL-aA releases aducanumab antibody (aA) and exosomes derived from Aβ antigen-specific Tregs (ATExo), which jointly manage Aβ and inflammatory microglia, thereby synergistically eradicating Aβ and reducing pro-inflammatory responses. In AD mouse models, ATExo-cL-aA demonstrates efficient brain accumulation, robust Aβ removal, microglial normalization, neuroinflammation attenuation, and synaptic preservation, ultimately leading to improved cognitive function. These findings highlight ATExo-cL-aA as next-generation immunotherapeutics that transcend the limitations of conventional antibody-based treatments for AD.

10.1038/s41598-021-98584-7	Large-bodied birds are over-represented in unstructured citizen science data.	Callaghan CT, Poore AGB, Hofmann M, Roberts CJ, Pereira HM	Citizen science platforms are quickly accumulating hundreds of millions of biodiversity observations around the world annually. Quantifying and correcting for the biases in citizen science datasets remains an important first step before these data are used to address ecological questions and monitor biodiversity. One source of potential bias among datasets is the difference between those citizen science programs that have unstructured protocols and those that have semi-structured or structured protocols for submitting observations. To quantify biases in an unstructured citizen science platform, we contrasted bird observations from the unstructured iNaturalist platform with that from a semi-structured citizen science platform-eBird-for the continental United States. We tested whether four traits of species (body size, commonness, flock size, and color) predicted if a species was under- or over-represented in the unstructured dataset compared with the semi-structured dataset. We found strong evidence that large-bodied birds were over-represented in the unstructured citizen science dataset; moderate evidence that common species were over-represented in the unstructured dataset; strong evidence that species in large groups were over-represented; and no evidence that colorful species were over-represented in unstructured citizen science data. Our results suggest that biases exist in unstructured citizen science data when compared with semi-structured data, likely as a result of the detectability of a species and the inherent recording process. Importantly, in programs like iNaturalist the detectability process is two-fold-first, an individual organism needs to be detected, and second, it needs to be photographed, which is likely easier for many large-bodied species. Our results indicate that caution is warranted when using unstructured citizen science data in ecological modelling, and highlight body size as a fundamental trait that can be used as a covariate for modelling opportunistic species occurrence records, representing the detectability or identifiability in unstructured citizen science datasets. Future research in this space should continue to focus on quantifying and documenting biases in citizen science data, and expand our research by including structured citizen science data to understand how biases differ among unstructured, semi-structured, and structured citizen science platforms.

We utilize nucleoside-modified mRNA in lipid nanoparticles (mRNA-LNP) and unmodified self-amplifying mRNA in modified dendritic nanoparticles (sam-MDNP), expressing chimeric hemagglutinin (cHA) antigens to induce stalk-specific humoral immunity in non-human primates with pre-existing influenza virus immunity. mRNA-LNP immunization induces strong stalk-specific binding antibodies capable of protecting mice from lethal heterologous influenza virus challenges and bone marrow plasma cells (BMPCs) that persist for up to 8 months. sam-MDNP vaccine induces lower humoral immunity, despite showing strong innate activation. Transcriptomic and cytokine analyses reveal a more persistent induction of interferon responses, interleukin (IL)-1β signaling, and IL-6 production in the mRNA-LNP group, correlating with the induction of serum antibody responses and BMPCs. These results identify a transcriptional signature associated with induction of BMPCs following mRNA vaccination and highlight the utility of cHA-based mRNA-LNP vaccines in inducing persistent stalk-directed protective antibody responses.

10.3390/medicina61091569	Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPIs)-An Evidence-Based Review of Indications, Efficacy,	Andrawes M, Andrawes W, Das A, Siau K	"Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are among the most prescribed drugs worldwide owing to their proven efficacy in symptom control and mucosal healing for acid-related disorders including gastroesophageal reflux disease (GORD), peptic ulcer disease, Helicobacter pylori eradication, functional dyspepsia, and gastroprotection in high-risk patients. However, long-term use beyond approved indications is increasingly common and has raised safety concerns. Observational studies link chronic PPI use to a myriad of adverse outcomes such as enteric infections (e.g., Clostridioides difficile), nutrient deficiencies (magnesium, vitamin B12), osteoporotic fractures, chronic kidney disease, dementia, and gastric and colorectal cancer. While causality is not always established, these associations warrant cautious risk-benefit assessment in patients receiving prolonged therapy. Current guidelines advocate periodic review of ongoing PPI use and emphasise deprescribing where appropriate. Strategies include dose reduction, on-demand or intermittent use, and switching to H2-receptor antagonists, particularly in patients with non-erosive reflux disease or functional dyspepsia. Tools from the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, American College of Gastroenterology, and the Canadian Deprescribing Network assist clinicians in identifying candidates for tapering or discontinuation. This narrative review focuses on the concept of ""PPI stewardship"" by providing an evidence-based overview of PPI indications, risks, and deprescribing strategies to promote appropriate, safer, and patient-centred use of acid-suppressive therapy."

10.3390/nu17183000	Effect of Apple Cider Vinegar Intake on Body Composition in Humans with Type 2	Castagna A, Ferro Y, Noto FR, Bruno R, Aragao Guimaraes A, Pujia C, Mazza E, Maurotti S, Montalcini T, Pujia A	Background: Apple cider vinegar (ACV) is a naturally fermented beverage with potential metabolic health benefits; however, its effects on weight loss remain controversial. This systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was conducted to assess the effect of ACV on anthropometric measurements in adults. Methods: We performed a systematic search of PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and CENTRAL up to March 2025 for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in adults (≥18 years) evaluating the effects of ACV for ≥4 weeks on body composition parameters. Primary outcomes included changes in body weight, BMI, waist circumference, and other anthropometric measures. Risk of bias was assessed using the Revised Cochrane Risk-of-bias tool. Results: Out of 2961 reports screened, 10 RCTs comprising a total of 789 participants were eligible for inclusion in this meta-analysis. The pooled results using a random-effects model showed that daily ACV intake significantly reduced body weight [SMD: -0.39; 95% CI: -0.63, -0.15; p = 0.001; I(2) = 62%], BMI [SMD: -0.65; 95% CI: -1.05, -0.26; p = 0.001; I(2) = 83%], and WC [SMD: -0.34; 95% CI: -0.67, -0.02; p = 0.04; I(2) = 61%]. However, no significant effects of ACV were observed on the other body composition parameters analyzed. Sensitivity analyses excluding high-risk-of-bias studies confirmed the robustness of ACV's beneficial effects on body weight and BMI. Subgroup analyses suggested that ACV consumption significantly improved anthropometric parameters when administered for up to 12 weeks, at a dose of 30 mL/day, and in adults who were overweight, obese, or had type 2 diabetes. Conclusions: Overall, this meta-analysis suggests that ACV supplementation may be a promising and accessible adjunctive strategy for short-term weight management in adults with excess body weight or metabolic complications.

This study aimed to explore the potential role of glycolytic reprogramming in the production of proinflammatory cytokines by macrophages in RA. METHODS: The Seahorse assay was conducted on RA or healthy control (HC) serum-treated human monocyte-derived macrophages (HMDMs) to evaluate glycolysis levels. RNA sequencing was performed to identify activated signaling pathways and key molecules in HMDMs stimulated by RA serum. The proinflammatory cytokines and hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) were verified by Western blotting and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). RESULTS: We found that HMDMs stimulated with RA serum showed higher aerobic glycolysis levels than those treated with HC serum, along with higher expression of glycolysis-related genes, including hexokinase2 (HK2), pyruvate kinase L/R (PKLR), and phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (PGK1). Furthermore, RA serum-treated macrophages exhibited a higher level of interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), and the expression of IL-1β positively correlated with HK2. Inhibition of glycolysis by 3-bromopyruvate (3BrPA) or HK2 knockdown significantly suppressed IL-1β production in macrophages. The	Arthritis research & therapy	2025 Sep 26
10.1186/s13024-025-00891-4	The Hippo signaling pathway as a therapeutic target in Alzheimer's disease.	Chen D, Wigglesworth-Littlewood S, Gunn-Moore FJ	The Hippo signaling pathway is well-known for its regulation of organ size, cell proliferation, apoptosis, and cell migration and differentiation. Recent studies have demonstrated that Hippo signaling also plays important roles in the nervous system, being involved in neuroinflammation, neuronal differentiation, and neuronal death and degeneration. As such, dysregulation of Hippo signaling, particularly of its core kinases MST1/2 and LATS1/2, has begun to attract attention in the Alzheimer's disease (AD) field. Here, we discuss the therapeutic potential of targeting the Hippo pathway in AD by providing an overview of Hippo signaling with regards to its function in the nervous system, evidence for its dysregulation in AD patients and models, and recent studies involving genetic or pharmacological modulation of this pathway in AD.

10.1016/j.chom.2025.09.006	The microbiota extends the reproductive lifespan of mice by safeguarding the	Munyoki SK, Goff JP, Reshke A, Wilderoter E, Mafarachisi N, Kolobaric A, Sheng Y, Mullett SJ, King GE, DeSchepper JD, Bookser RJ, Castro CA, Gelhaus SL, Grizotte-Lake M, Morrison KE, Zeleznik AJ, Hand TW, Brieño-Enriquez MA, Jašarević E	Infertility affects one in six people, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. We show that the microbiota governs female reproductive longevity in mice. Germ-free mice have fewer primordial follicles, increased atresia, and ovarian fibrosis, leading to smaller litters, fewer offspring, and a shorter reproductive lifespan. Germ-free mice are born with a similar ovarian reserve but display excessive activation, impaired progression, and increased atresia during post-natal development. Microbiome colonization during a critical post-natal window rescues premature ovarian reserve loss by normalizing follicle kinetics and gene expression patterns. These changes parallel increased short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), and SCFA administration mitigates ovarian dysfunction in germ-free mice. Similar oocyte dysfunction occurred in conventionally raised mice fed a high-fat diet, but additional dietary fiber helped preserve oocyte quality and embryo competence. Thus, host-microbe interactions shape female fertility, and microbiota-targeted interventions may offer strategies to address reproductive disorders.	Cell host & microbe	2025 Sep 25
10.1016/j.xcrm.2025.102374	A foundational architecture for AI agents in healthcare.	Liu F, Niu Y, Zhang Q, Wang K, Dong Z, Wong IN, Cheng L, Li T, Duan L, Li K, Li G, Hou TW, Fok M, Luo H, Chen X, Zhang K, Yin Y	Medical AI agents represent a transformative paradigm in healthcare, distinguished from traditional AI by their autonomy, adaptability, and ability to manage complex tasks. This review introduces a conceptual framework for these agents built on four core components: planning, action, reflection, and memory. We examine the framework's application across key clinical domains, from enhancing diagnostic accuracy and personalizing treatment to guiding robotic surgery and enabling real-time patient monitoring. The review critically analyzes implementation challenges, including technical integration, clinician adoption, regulatory adaptation, and ethical considerations like data privacy and algorithmic bias. Future directions are explored, including the shift toward proactive, multi-agent collaborative systems and the visionary AI Agent Hospital concept. While these agents hold immense potential to revolutionize healthcare delivery by improving efficiency and patient outcomes, their successful and equitable integration hinges on navigating these profound technical, ethical, and regulatory hurdles.

10.1038/s42255-025-01355-1	A non-apoptotic caspase-8-meteorin pathway in hepatocytes promotes MASH fibrosis.	Wang X, Moore MP, Shi H, Xiao Y, Zhang J, Faccioli LAP, Hu Z, Khalid S, Saleheen D, Stupack DG, Kisseleva T, Soto Gutierrez A, Lazar MA, Tabas I	Metabolic-dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) is the leading cause of chronic liver disease, but an incomplete understanding of MASH-induced liver fibrosis has limited therapeutic options. Here we show that hepatocyte caspase-8 drives MASH fibrosis through an apoptosis-independent mechanism. Hepatic caspase-8 expression correlates with liver fibrosis in both human and experimental MASH, and hepatocyte-specific caspase-8 deletion in male mice with MASH suppressed liver fibrosis and hepatic stellate cell (HSC) activation without affecting hepatocyte apoptosis. Mechanistic studies showed that a caspase-8-YY1 pathway in hepatocytes induces secretory meteorin (Metrn), which activates HSCs via a c-Kit-STAT3 pathway. Meteorin expression was increased in human and male mouse MASH livers and decreased by deletion of hepatocyte caspase-8 in MASH mice and human and mouse primary hepatocytes. Genetic restoration of hepatocyte meteorin in hepatocyte-caspase-8-deleted MASH mice restored HSC activation and liver fibrosis while silencing hepatocyte meteorin lowered liver fibrosis. These findings reveal a therapeutically targetable pathway promoting MASH fibrosis involving a non-apoptotic function of caspase-8 and a newly discovered HSC activator, meteorin.

10.1038/s41564-025-02120-6	Nasal Staphylococcus aureus carriage promotes depressive behaviour in mice via	Xiang G, Wang Y, Ni K, Luo H, Liu Q, Song Y, Miao P, He L, Jian Y, Yang Z, Chen T, Xu K, Sun X, Shen Z, Ji C, Zhao N, He M, Pan Y, Luo Y, Hu J, Otto M, Li M	The human microbiome has a pronounced impact on human physiology and behaviour. Despite its unique anatomical connection to the brain, the role of the nasal microbiome in neurological diseases is understudied. Here, using human data and experiments in mice, we show that nasal Staphylococcus aureus is linked to depression. Nasal microbiome analyses revealed a positive correlation between depression scores and S. aureus abundance among patients with depression and healthy controls. Metabolomics of the nasal cavity showed decreased sex hormones, estradiol and testosterone in patients with depression versus controls. Nasal microbiota transplants from patients reproduced depression-like behaviour in mice with differential abundance of S. aureus. Further homology and mutational analysis uncovered an S. aureus sex hormone-degrading enzyme, 17b-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (Hsd12), which degraded testosterone and estradiol in mice, leading to lower levels of dopamine and serotonin in the murine brain. These findings reveal a nasal commensal that influences depressive behaviour and provides insights into the nose-brain axis.	Nature microbiology	2025 Sep 22
10.1177/21501319251379740	Healthcare Utilization Unchanged in the Control Arm of a Randomized Clinical	Gongloor P, Nadeem S, Yu X, Raji M, Mena KD, Vaughan EM	BACKGROUND: In low-income settings, clinical trial participation may influence participant behavior, including among control groups. Increased access to care and heightened health awareness during trial enrollment could lead to altered behaviors, a phenomenon known as the Hawthorne effect, which may obscure true intervention impacts; however, this effect remains poorly studied in low-income environments. AIM: To conduct a secondary exploratory analysis of healthcare utilization among control participants of a randomized clinical trial (RCT). METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed electronic medical records from the control arm (n = 26) of an RCT involving low-income Hispanic adults with type 2 diabetes receiving care at a community clinic. Before randomization to a 12-month diabetes education intervention or usual care (control), participants underwent on-site measurements of HbA1c, blood pressure, and weight. Healthcare utilization among control participants was compared during the year before and throughout the study, including all types of exposures: provider visits and other services (eg, orders). RESULTS: Total healthcare utilization was similar between the pre-period (11.9 exposures/year) and the study-period (11.4 exposures/year; P = .93), with no significant changes across visit types. There were no significant differences in fitted mean monthly visits between the pre- and study-periods (P = .93), nor over time (P = .89). CONCLUSIONS: This exploratory study found no evidence of a Hawthorne effect on healthcare utilization among control participants. While this may suggest consistent healthcare behaviors, it may also highlight an important public health concern: individuals in low-income settings may lack the resources to translate increased awareness into health-related action. Larger studies are needed to further elucidate behavioral patterns in low-income populations.	Journal of primary care & community health	2025 Jan-Dec
10.1186/s40001-025-03108-y	Identification of hub gene and immune infiltration in Lyme disease revealed by	Dong Y, Liu M, Luo Y, Chen Y, Chen X, Liu X, Cai X, Yang F, Song C, Zhou G	"INTRODUCTION: Lyme disease (LD), caused by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi (Bb), is a multisystem disorder with early symptoms such as erythema migrans and late manifestations including arthritis and neuroborreliosis. The molecular mechanisms driving tissue damage and inflammatory dysregulation in LD remain incompletely characterized. Given the central role of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in orchestrating immune responses, we aimed to identify optimal feature genes (OFGs) within PBMCs associated with LD pathogenesis and delineate their immune infiltration patterns using integrated bioinformatics. METHODS: Transcriptomic datasets (GSE42606, GSE68765, GSE103481) were retrieved from GEO. Differential expression analysis identified LD-related genes. Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) screened disease-associated modules. Feature selection was performed via SVM-Recursive Feature Elimination (SVM-RFE), Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression, and random forest (RF) to pinpoint OFGs. Immune cell infiltration was quantified using CIBERSORT, followed by correlation analysis between OFGs and immune subsets. The Single-gene gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was performed to explore the functional associations of OFGs. Biological pathways linked to OFGs were inferred by single-sample GSEA (ssGSEA). Diagnostic utility was assessed via ROC curves and nomogram modeling. Finally, we used RT-qPCR to confirm the bioinformatics results. RESULTS: Our study identified 174 DEGs among the LD patients, with 156 genes located within the ""turquoise"" module by WGCNA, exhibiting the most robust correlation with clinical characteristics. Among these, KIAA1199 turned out to be the unique OFG, selected via three distinct machine learning methodologies, possessing exceptional diagnostic potential. The Single-gene gene set enrichment analysis showed KIAA1199 was strongly correlated with multiple immune-related pathways. Furthermore, RT-qPCR validated candidate gene expression within a THP-1 cellular model. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, this study integrated WGCNA and machine learning methodologies to identify one core gene associated with LD from PBMC gene expression data: KIAA1199. The predictive model constructed using these genes demonstrated robust diagnostic accuracy, providing a basis for further research on host immune responses and the development of new diagnostic methods."

10.1186/s12951-025-03676-5	Neutrophil membrane-encapsulated nanosonosensitizer with ultrasound-reinforced	Du C, Wang S, Cheng Y, Li J, Zhang Y, Li Z, Zhu B, Wu Z, Zhang X, Zhou L	Pneumonia caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) infection remains a formidable clinical challenge due to persistent biofilm formation and intrinsic antibiotic resistance, exacerbated by bacterial iron homeostasis that stabilizes biofilm architecture and neutralizes oxidative stress. Herein, we present Fe/TNT@NM, a biomimetic nanosonosensitizer activated by ultrasound (US) to dismantle biofilms through dual extracellular-intracellular mechanisms. The nanosonosensitizer features an iron-doped titanate nanotube (Fe/TNT) core encapsulated within a neutrophil membrane (NM). Under US irradiation, Fe/TNT@NM generates sonodynamic reactive oxygen species (ROS) extracellularly and enhances Fe(3+) release. These ions catalyze the Fenton reaction extracellularly to amplify chemodynamic effects and disrupt intracellular iron homeostasis, triggering bacterial ferroptosis. The NM coating enables immune evasion and biofilm-targeted delivery. This ultrasound-reinforced ferroptosis strategy synchronizes extracellular ROS storms with intracellular iron dyshomeostasis, achieving dual-action biofilm dismantling and eradication of drug-resistant P. aeruginosa. In a murine pneumonia model, Fe/TNT@NM suppresses biofilms and mitigates pulmonary injury. By converging biomimetic targeting, sonodynamic-chemodynamic cascades, and ultrasound-augmented ferroptosis, this nanosonosensitizer presents a paradigm-shifting approach to combat refractory biofilm infections and antibiotic resistance.

10.1016/j.ejmech.2025.118197	Bufalin targeting METTL17 inhibits the occurrence and metastasis of oral cancer	Zhang H, Sun F, Ding X, Dong X, Yang F, Chen R, Zhang X, Wen Z, Su M, Yu C, Wang Y, Yang L, Li B	Oral cancer (OC) is a malignant tumor that arises at the mucosal tissues of the oral cavity and is commonly treated with surgical resection. Bufalin is one of the most potent anticancer monomers extracted from bufonis venenum and has been shown to have anticancer effects against a wide range of cancers, including lung cancer, gastric cancer and hepatocellular carcinomas. However, there are fewer studies on the role of bufalin in OC and a lack of clear targets. Moreover, bufalin is more difficult to apply clinically due to its cardiac glycoside effects. Notably, oral cancer is a facial tumor, and bufalin acts first in the oral tissues and does not need to go through the blood circulation to reach the heart, which greatly mitigates the risk and overcomes the major limitation. The effects of bufalin on the proliferation and migration of oral cancer cells were detected by CCK-8 assay, wound healing assay, transwell assay and Western blot. Potential direct interacting proteins of bufalin were screened by human proteomic microarray, and the binding sites were predicted using molecular docking technology. In vitro and vivo biological experiments were performed to verify the role of bufalin direct interacting protein and the mechanism by which bufalin targets this protein to inhibit OC metastasis. The results showed that bufalin inhibited the proliferation and migration of OC cell lines from Cal-27, HN30 and	European journal of medicinal chemistry	2025 Sep 23
10.3390/molecules30183823	Vitamin D Associated with Exercise Can Be Used as a Promising Tool in	Farina G, Crescioli C	Neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, and Huntington's disease, represent unmet medical and social needs. Still, no definitive cure exists for these illnesses, hence a therapeutic approach with molecules able to prevent/downtone/modify the disease seems highly attractive. Remarkably, a higher risk of neurodegenerative disease is associated with low vitamin D levels. Vitamin D is a multifaceted molecule able to target critical neuroinflammatory processes underlying neurodegeneration, acting through genomic or rapid signaling. This narrative review aims to focus on vitamin D's potential to be an optimal neuroprotective molecule, based on its ability to target and counteract aberrant biomolecular processes involved in neuroinflammation/neurodegeneration. Noticeably, exercise can potentiate vitamin D's protective effect through some anti-inflammatory actions exerted on shared biomolecular targets. Thus, although vitamin D is not strictly a drug, it could be potentially allocated within the therapeutic approach to neurodegenerative diseases in combination with adapted exercise, best as an early intervention. Topics on the complexity concerning the doses for supplementation and data discrepancy from trials are addressed. The urgent demand is to test and clarify vitamin D efficacy and safety, combined or not with exercise, in clinical settings.	Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)	2025 Sep 21
10.3390/molecules30183814	The Efficacy of Melatonergic Receptor Agonists Used in Clinical Practice in	Żełabowski K, Pichowicz W, Skowron I, Szwach J, Biedka K, Wesołowski M, Błaszczyk K, Ziobro O, Petrov W, Kukula-Koch W, Chłopaś-Konowałek A	Insomnia is a common and complex disorder, rooted in the dysregulation of circadian rhythms, impaired neurotransmitter function, and disturbances in sleep-wake homeostasis. While conventional hypnotics such as benzodiazepines and Z-drugs are effective in the short term, their use is limited by a high potential for dependence, cognitive side effects, and withdrawal symptoms. In contrast, melatonergic receptor agonists-melatonin, ramelteon, tasimelteon, and agomelatine-represent a pharmacologically targeted alternative that modulates MT1 and MT2 receptors, which are pivotal to the regulation of circadian timing and sleep initiation. Clinical evidence supports the efficacy of these agents in reducing sleep onset latency, extending total sleep duration, and re-aligning disrupted circadian rhythms, particularly among older individuals and patients with non-24 h sleep-wake disorders. Notably, agomelatine offers additional antidepressant properties through selective antagonism of the 5-HT(2C) receptor in micromolar concentrations. In contrast, its agonistic activity at melatonergic receptors is observed in the low sub-nanomolar range, which illustrates the complexity of this drug's interactions with the human body. All compounds reviewed demonstrate a generally favorable safety and tolerability profile. Accumulating evidence highlights that selected medicinal plants, such as chamomilla, lemon balm, black cumin, valeriana, passionflower and lavender, may exert relevant hypnotic or anxiolytic effects, thus complementing melatonergic strategies in the management of insomnia. This structured narrative review presents a comprehensive analysis of the molecular pharmacology, receptor affinity, signaling pathways, and clinical outcomes associated with melatonergic agents. It also examines their functional interplay with serotonergic, GABAergic, dopaminergic, and orexinergic systems involved in arousal and sleep regulation. Through comparative synthesis of pharmacokinetics and neurochemical mechanisms, this work aims to inform the development of evidence-based strategies for the treatment of insomnia and circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders.

Ninjurin-1 (NINJ1) is a recently identified mediator of plasma membrane rupture but functions diversely in different types of cell death. However, little is known about the role of NINJ1 in IAV-induced PANoptosis and viral pneumonia. Here, we report that IAV infection triggered an increase in the expression of NINJ1, which then oligomerized and mediated cell lysis in infected macrophages. The deficiency of NINJ1 prevented plasma membrane rupture and the release of DAMPs and IL-1β without affecting the progression of cell death. Activation of any single PANoptosis pathway was sufficient to trigger the oligomerization of NINJ1 and robust cell lysis. Accordingly, only when all PANoptosis pathways were concurrently blocked could the oligomerization of NINJ1, cell death, and cell rupture be prevented. Ablation of NINJ1 in vivo also alleviated IAV-induced lung injury and mortality. Furthermore, we revealed an association between NINJ1 upregulation and poor outcomes in patients with COVID-19. Collectively, our findings indicate a pivotal role of NINJ1 in the immunopathology of IAV infection and its potential as a bioindicator of disease severity and prognosis in viral pneumonia and viral sepsis.

10.1002/alz.70726	Alzheimer's disease diagnostic progression is associated with cerebrovascular	Edwards NC, Lao PJ, Alshikho MJ, Ericsson OM, Rizvi B, Petersen ME, O'Bryant S, Flores-Aguilar L, Simoes S, Mapstone M, Tudorascu DL, Janelidze S, Hansson O, Handen BL, Christian BT, Lee JH, Lai F, Rosas HD, Zaman S, Lott IT, Yassa MA, Gutierrez J, Wilcock DM, Head E, Brickman AM	INTRODUCTION: Despite having few vascular risk factors, people with Down syndrome (DS) have MRI evidence of cerebrovascular disease (CVD) and neuroinflammation that worsens with Alzheimer's disease (AD) severity. We investigated whether markers of CVD and inflammation are associated with AD-related diagnostic progression in people with DS. METHODS: We included 149 participants (mean age [SD] = 44.6 [9]) from the Alzheimer's Biomarkers Consortium-Down Syndrome who had two (n = 24) or three follow-up visits (n = 125). We derived white matter hyperintensity (WMH) volume and plasma biomarker (glial fibrillary acidic protein [GFAP], amyloid beta [Aβ]42/Aβ40, hyperphosphorylated tau-217 [p-tau217], and neurofilament light [NfL]) concentrations at baseline and examined their association with progression in clinical diagnosis. RESULTS: Higher baseline WMH volume and higher GFAP were associated with a greater likelihood of diagnostic progression. Combining WMH and GFAP with p-tau217 improved clinical conversion classification accuracy over AD biomarkers alone. Among individuals with evidence of amyloidosis, both WMH and GFAP were associated with clinical progression. DISCUSSION: In DS, markers of CVD and inflammation are independently and synergistically associated with clinical AD progression. HIGHLIGHTS: Higher baseline white matter hyperintensity (WMH) volume and plasma glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) concentration were associated with a higher likelihood of progressing from cognitively stable to either mild cognitive impairment or clinical Alzheimer's disease in Down syndrome. WMH volume and GFAP concentration discriminated between those who progressed and those who did not. Models including the independent and interactive effects of WMH and GFAP more accurately discriminated between participants who progressed diagnostically from those who did not. Individuals with evidence of amyloid pathology were more likely to progress if they also had elevated WMH or GFAP.	Alzheimer's & dementia : the journal of the Alzheimer's Association	2025 Oct
10.1089/rej.2012.1389	Protective effects of ginger root extract on Alzheimer disease-induced behavioral	Zeng GF, Zhang ZY, Lu L, Xiao DQ, Zong SH, He JM	The aim of this study was to assess the ability of a traditional Chinese medicinal ginger root extract (GRE) to prevent behavioral dysfunction in the Alzheimer disease (AD) rat model. Rat AD models were established by an operation (OP) in which rats were treated with a one-time intra-cerebroventricuIar injection of amyloid β-protein (Aβ) and continuous gavage of aluminum chloride every day for 4 weeks. GRE was administered intra-gastrically to rats. After 35 days, learning and memory were assessed in all of the rats. Brain sections were processed for immunohistochemistry and Hematoxylin & Eosin (H&E) and Nissl staining. The latency to show significant memory deficits was shorter in the group that received OP with a high dose of GRE (HG)(OP+HG) than in the groups that received OP with a low or moderate dose of GRE (LG, MG)(OP+LG, OP+MG) (p<0.05). The expression of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) in the OP+MG and OP+LG groups was up-regulated compared to the OP+HG groups (p<0.05). The rats in the OP+HG groups had lower levels of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), and malondialdehyde (MDA) expression than the rats in the OP+MG and OP+LG groups (p<0.05). This experiment demonstrates that the administration of GRE reverses behavioral dysfunction and prevents AD-like symptoms in our rat model.	Rejuvenation research	2013 Apr

Imbalanced nucleotide synthesis triggers the release of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) to the cytosol and an innate immune response through cGAS-STING signalling(3). However, how nucleotide deficiency drives mtDNA-dependent inflammation has not been elucidated. Here we show that nucleotide imbalance leads to an increased misincorporation of ribonucleotides into mtDNA during age-dependent renal inflammation in a mouse model lacking the mitochondrial exonuclease MGME1(4), in various tissues of aged mice and in cells lacking the mitochondrial i-AAA protease YME1L. Similarly, reduced deoxyribonucleotide synthesis increases the ribonucleotide content of mtDNA in cell-cycle-arrested senescent cells. This leads to mtDNA release into the cytosol, cGAS-STING activation and the mtDNA-dependent senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), which can be suppressed by exogenously added deoxyribonucleosides. Our results highlight the sensitivity of mtDNA to aberrant ribonucleotide incorporation and show that imbalanced nucleotide metabolism leads to age- and mtDNA-dependent inflammatory responses and SASP in senescence.

10.1016/j.clinph.2020.11.036	Influence of unfused cranial bones on magnetoencephalography signals in human	Lew S, Hämäläinen MS, Ahlfors SP, Okada Y	OBJECTIVE: To clarify the effects of unfused cranial bones on magnetoencephalography (MEG) signals during early development. METHODS: In a simulation study, we compared the MEG signals over a spherical head model with a circular hole mimicking the anterior fontanel to those over the same head model without the fontanel for different head and fontanel sizes with varying skull thickness and conductivity. RESULTS: The fontanel had small effects according to three indices. The sum of differences in signal over a sensor array due to a fontanel, for example, was < 6% of the sum without the fontanel. However, the fontanel effects were extensive for dipole sources deep in the brain or outside the fontanel for larger fontanels. The effects were comparable in magnitude for tangential and radial sources. Skull thickness significantly increased the effect, while skull conductivity had minor effects. CONCLUSION: MEG signal is weakly affected by a fontanel. However, the effects can be extensive and significant for radial sources, thicker skull and large fontanels. The fontanel effects can be intuitively explained by the concept of secondary sources at the fontanel wall. SIGNIFICANCE: The minor influence of unfused cranial bones simplifies MEG analysis, but it should be considered for quantitative analysis.

A total of 858 students aged 12 years at baseline (422 girls and 436 boys) were examined from 2004-2005 to 2009-2011. Dietary data were assessed from validated semiquantitative food frequency questionnaires. Blood pressure was measured using a standard protocol. In girls, after adjusting for age, ethnicity, parental education, parental history of hypertension, baseline height, baseline blood pressure, change in body mass index, and time spent in physical and sedentary activities, each 1-SD (1-SD = 7.10 g/d) increase in baseline dietary intake of total fiber was associated with a 0.96-, 0.62-, and 0.75-mmHg decrease in mean systolic (P = 0.02), diastolic (P = 0.01), and arterial blood pressures (P = 0.002), respectively, 5 years later. In girls, each 1-SD increase in dietary glycemic index, glycemic load, carbohydrate, and fructose was concurrently related to increases of 1.81 (P = 0.001), 4.02 (P = 0.01), 4.74 (P = 0.01), and 1.80 mm Hg (P = 0.03) in systolic blood pressure, respectively, >5 years. Significant associations between carbohydrate nutrition variables and blood pressure were not observed among boys. Excessive dietary intake of carbohydrates, specifically from high glycemic index/glycemic load foods, could adversely influence blood pressure, particularly in girls, whereas fiber-rich diets may be protective against elevated blood pressure during adolescence.

10.3390/healthcare13182259	Real-World Safety Concerns of Tirzepatide: A Retrospective Analysis of FAERS Data	Almansour HA, Thaibah HA, Alfarhan M, Al-Qahtani SA, Khardali AA, Alshammari TM	Background: Tirzepatide (Mounjaro or Zepbound), a dual GLP-1/GIP receptor agonist, is approved for type 2 diabetes and weight management. Despite its efficacy, real-world safety data remain limited. This study analyzed post-marketing adverse events (AEs) associated with tirzepatide using the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) to identify emerging safety concerns. Methods: FAERS reports from 2022 to Q1 2025 were analyzed. Disproportionality analyses (proportional reporting ratio [PRR], reporting odds ratio [ROR], empirical Bayes geometric mean [EBGM], and information component [IC]) were performed to detect safety signals. Reports were stratified by year, demographics, and AE type, focusing on cases in which tirzepatide was the primary suspect. Results: Among 65,974 reports, the majority originated from the U.S. (96%), with middle-aged females (40-59 years; 67%) most frequently affected. Incorrect dose administration was the top AE, increasing 8-fold from 1248 (2022) to 9800 (2024), with strong risk signals (ROR 22.15, 95% CI (20.75-23.65), and ROR 23.43, 95% CI (22.82-24.05), respectively, and PRR 16.80, 95% CI (15.74-17.93), and PRR 17.62, 95% CI (17.16-18.09), respectively). Other common AEs included injection-site reactions (e.g., pain [5273 cases in 2024]), gastrointestinal issues (nausea [3602 in 2024]), and off-label use. Class-related AEs (e.g., decreased appetite and blood glucose fluctuations) were also reported. Conclusions: Tirzepatide is associated with significant dosing errors, injection-site reactions, and gastrointestinal AEs in real-world use. The rising trend in reports underscores the need for enhanced provider and patient education, clearer dosing guidelines, and proactive monitoring. Further research is warranted to explore causative factors and optimize risk mitigation strategies.	Healthcare (Basel, Switzerland)	2025 Sep 9
10.1126/sciadv.ady5876	The polymerase-associated factor 1 complex modulates the growth-defense tradeoff	Guo Y, Li C, Liu Y, Mao H, Zhang Y, Genschik P, Wang L, Yan S	Plants have evolved sophisticated mechanisms to balance growth and defense. The evolutionarily conserved polymerase-associated factor 1 complex (PAF1C) plays multiple roles in transcription. Here, we show that PAF1C regulates the growth-defense tradeoff by repressing defense genes expression in Arabidopsis. Loss of PAF1C leads to increased expression of defense genes, enhanced disease resistance, but compromised growth. Mechanistically, PAF1C binds to defense genes, where it interacts with histone deacetylases, such as HDA6, to promote histone deacetylation, thereby repressing defense genes expression. The plant immune hormone salicylic acid (SA) promotes the interaction between PAF1 and the SA receptor NPR1, which functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase to mediate the polyubiquitination and degradation of PAF1. Genetically, loss of PAF1 suppresses the immune defects of the npr1 mutant, supporting the notion that PAF1 functions downstream of NPR1. Collectively, this study identifies the NPR1-PAF1C-HDA6 module that regulates the growth-defense tradeoff.	Science advances	2025 Sep 26
10.1038/s41467-025-63472-5	V-ATPase-dependent induction of selective autophagy.	Huang Y, Dialynaki D, Lei Y, Zhang Z, Evans CR, Klionsky DJ	"The general consensus is that the vacuolar-type H(+)-translocating ATPase (V-ATPase) is critical for macroautophagy/autophagy. However, there is a fundamental conundrum because follicular lymphoma-associated mutations in the V-ATPase result in lysosomal/vacuolar deacidification but elevated autophagy activity under nutrient-replete conditions and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, working in yeast, we show that V-ATPase dysfunction activates a selective autophagy flux termed ""V-ATPase-dependent autophagy "". By combining transcriptomic and proteomic profiling, along with genome-wide suppressor screening approaches, we found that V-ATPase-dependent autophagy is regulated through a unique mechanism distinct from classical nitrogen starvation-induced autophagy. Tryptophan metabolism negatively regulates V-ATPase-dependent autophagy via two parallel effectors. On the one hand, it activates ribosome biogenesis, thus repressing the translation of the transcription factor Gcn4/ATF4. On the other hand, tryptophan fuels NAD(+) de novo biosynthesis to inhibit autophagy. These results provide an explanation for the mutational activation of autophagy seen in follicular lymphoma patients."	Nature communications	2025 Sep 26

However, there is no globally agreed CR definition or indications for biological disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (bDMARDs). METHODS: A survey on 'Biologics in Monogenic Autoinflammatory Diseases', part of the 'Clinical Practice Strategies' (CLiPS) initiative, was conducted by a JIR cohort-initiated eCOST network among expert participants worldwide. Our primary aim was to provide a flowchart reflecting the different CR definitions and present data regarding bDMARD indications. The secondary aim was to determine how specific biases influence clinical approaches. We analysed the CliPS according to the experience levels of physicians, country-specific FMF prevalence, countries' gross domestic product, bDMARD availability and reimbursement policies of the countries. RESULTS: A total of 223 responses from 46 countries were included in the study. Almost half of the respondents (73/160, 45.6%) indicated that three to four attacks within the preceding 6 months were necessary for their CR definition. The most frequently used acute-phase reactant was C-reactive protein (157/164, 95.7%). Almost three-fourths of the respondents (74%, n=165) considered that supplementary factors, including complications of FMF, attack severity, elevated activity scores, patient-reported outcome and quality of life scales, influenced their CR definition. CONCLUSION: We present a novel flowchart describing physicians' general attitudes and unique findings regarding management strategies for colchicine-resistant FMF and shifting trends influenced by epidemiological and socioeconomic factors.

This study aimed to compare the autonomic effects of pulsed field ablation (PFA) versus thermal ablation (TA) in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) through a pooled-analysis. METHODS: A systematic search of PubMed and Embase was conducted through April 5, 2025, to identify comparative studies. The primary outcome was increase-in-heart-rate (IHR) after ablation, and the secondary outcome was increase in serum S100B (IS100B), a marker of neural injury. RESULTS: Eight studies involving 1007 AF patients were included (mean age: 63,39 ± 10,75 years; 36.3% female; maximum follow-up: 12 months). Baseline characteristics, including the use of antiarrhythmic drugs, were similar between the PFA and TA groups. Pooled-analysis showed that PFA was associated with a significantly lower IHR compared to TA (PFA: 4.41 ± 8.86 bpm vs. TA: 10.81 ± 10.46 bpm; p < 0.00001). This difference persisted at midterm (3-6 months) and long-term (12 months) follow-up and remained consistent across age, sex, and different TA modalities (cryoballoon vs. radiofrequency). Correspondingly, the IS100B was significantly less pronounced after PFA (PFA: 33.27 ± 9.46 pg/ml vs. TA: 97.53 ± 31.88 pg/ml; p < 0.00001).

10.1016/j.medcli.2025.107184	GLP-1-based therapies for obesity: Impact on comorbidities or obesity-related	Vilarrasa N, Pellitero S	Agents targeting the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) are effective in managing metabolic conditions associated with obesity, such as obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), and chronic kidney disease (CKD). In OSA, studies with first generation GLP-1R agonists (ArGLP-1) and co-agonists (GLP-1/GIP) have demonstrated significant improvements in the apnea-hypopnea index and weight reduction. In MASLD, GLP-1RAs and co-agonists (GLP-1/GIP or GLP-1/glucagon) have shown efficacy in reducing hepatic fat, improving fibrosis, and resolving steatohepatitis, with promising results from trials such as ESSENCE and SYNERGY-NASH. In CKD, semaglutide has been associated with a reduction in renal events and slower disease progression. Beyond their metabolic and cardiovascular benefits, these agents represent a comprehensive approach to treating obesity and its complications, with ongoing research exploring their potential indications in chronic inflammatory diseases such as psoriasis and hidradenitis suppurativa.

Batsch seeds (Taoren), which were the components of promoting circulation and removing stasis in the anti-fibrotic herbal--- Fuzheng Huayu Formula (FZHY). It has demonstrated efficacy in alleviating hepatic fibrosis and portal hypertension (PH); however, its pharmacological mechanisms remain unclear. AIM OF THE STUDY: The aim is to investigate the effects and molecular mechanisms of DTF on liver fibrosis and PH. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In vivo experiments were evaluated using a CCl(4)-induced mouse model with rivaroxaban (RIVA) as a drug control. PH was assessed by direct puncture method. Fibrosis was assessed by Sirius red staining and hydroxyproline. Network pharmacology analysis predicted the potential molecules or signal mediators. In vitro, an LX-2 cells was activated with ET-1, and Y-33075 used as a drug control. ELISA, Western blot, immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence were conducted to assess the target expression of ET-1, ENDRA, ROCK, cAMP, PKA, MLC and p-MLC. RESULTS: DTF or RIVA could alleviate liver fibrosis and PH compared to the model group. Network pharmacology analysis suggested that cAMP/PKA/ROCK signaling pathway acted as a key target in DTF. In vivo, DTF or RIVA suppressed ET-1, EDNRA and ROCK expression, enhanced cAMP and PKA expression. In vitro, DTF or Y-33075 attenuated the activation of LX-2 cells induced by ET-1, down-regulated ROCK and p-MLC expression, up-regulated cAMP and PKA expression. CONCLUSIONS: DTF alleviates liver fibrosis and PH by regulating the cAMP/PKA/ROCK signaling pathway in activated HSCs.	Journal of ethnopharmacology	2025 Sep 25

Xenotransplantation using genetically modified porcine kidneys offers a promising alternative. Here, we report key physiological observations from the first-in-human porcine kidney xenograft over a 51 day postoperative follow-up period. The transplanted kidney maintained essential functions, including waste excretion, electrolyte regulation, and production of concentrated urine, while supporting blood pressure and sodium reabsorption despite reduced activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Sodium retention required diuretic therapy, and mild hypocalcemia and hyperphosphatemia occurred in the setting of pre-existing hypoparathyroidism. Markedly increased urinary uric acid excretion led to hypouricemia without evidence of urate nephropathy. This case demonstrates the ability of a porcine kidney to sustain vital metabolic functions in a living human, while highlighting areas for further research. These findings provide a foundation for optimizing post-transplant care and advancing xenotransplantation as a solution to the critical organ shortage.	Nature communications	2025 Sep 26

Although problems with perceived dignity increase in the context of cancer, the specific experience for those older compared with younger patients with advanced cancer has not been described despite its contributions to the wish to hasten death (WTHD). OBJECTIVES: To understand the influence of age group to the perception of dignity, considering changes in quality of life and the WTHD in patients with advanced cancer. METHODS: The Patient Dignity Inventory was administered to 194 patients with advanced cancer. The data were analyzed by separating the sample into age groups younger than 65 years (N = 106) or 65 years and older (N = 88). Linear regression models were adjusted with the explanatory variables of WTHD, quality of life, as well as functional status, physical dependence, depression, anxiety, and sociodemographic variables. RESULTS: Older patients showed a 2.6% decrease in the total scores of perceived dignity-related distress compared to younger patients. CONCLUSION: Older age could be a protective factor against the perception of loss of dignity in patients with advanced cancer, a more positive perspective of the aging experience.

10.1038/s41598-025-18867-1	Identification of regulated cell death related genes in polycystic ovary syndrome	Li R, Chen Q, Yan Y, Yang Y, Hu R	Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is one of the most prevalent endocrine disorders affecting women during their reproductive years, with global prevalence estimates ranging from 5 to 15%, depending on the diagnostic criteria used. Emerging evidence suggests that various forms of regulated cell death (RCD) mechanisms play a significant role in the development and progression of PCOS. However, existing research has yet to systematically investigate how RCD processes interact with the molecular pathophysiology of PCOS. Mapping these complex interactions-including the associated regulatory networks and molecular cascades-could provide critical insights into disease mechanisms. This study aims to identify specific RCD-related genetic markers and signaling pathways, which could serve as potential therapeutic targets for PCOS management. Our team conducted computational bioinformatics analyses to find differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between healthy ovarian tissues and those affected by PCOS, revealing 389 genes linked to RCD. Through machine learning techniques-including Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), Random Forest (RF), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms-we identified five critical hub genes. To gauge their diagnostic potential, we performed receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve evaluations and mapped out protein interaction networks (PPI) to uncover relationships among these key genes. We then delved deeper using Single-Sample Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (ssGSEA), Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment studies, and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway assessments to shed light on biological processes tied to the hub genes. These findings were corroborated through additional Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) validation. Leveraging the NetworkAnalyst and RegNetwork platforms, we predicted upstream regulators like microRNAs (miRNAs), transcription factors, and gene-associated compounds. Finally, interaction networks were visualized via Cytoscape to illustrate these complex relationships. Through comparative analysis of PCOS and control groups, DEGs were pinpointed and cross-referenced with genes linked to RCD mechanisms. Machine learning techniques highlighted five hub genes with significant biological relevance. Comprehensive bioinformatics profiling demonstrated that these key genes were significantly enriched in biological processes related to immune-inflammatory responses, metabolic regulation via adipocytokine signaling, reproductive hormone activity, and epigenetic regulation. Furthermore, we identified 25 therapeutic compounds, 42 regulatory miRNAs, and 30 transcription factors (TFs) with strong functional relationships to these critical genetic markers. We identified five RCD-related hub genes within the DEGs of PCOS and control samples and further analyzed upstream and downstream pathways, to elucidate potential pathogenic mechanisms.

10.1038/s12276-025-01534-w	Cholesterol-driven pathological astrocytic responses in diabetes-associated	Niu T, Wang S, Zhang H, Zhu W, Liu K, Zhou X, Sun R, Niu D, Yuan Y	The diabetic environment, characterized by hyperglycemia, advanced glycation end products and cerebral insulin resistance, triggers pathological astrocytic responses that contribute to cognitive decline in diabetes-associated cognitive impairment. Cholesterol accumulation in the brain, particularly in astrocytes, contributes to this pathological process. SCAP, a cholesterol sensor involved in lipid imbalances, regulates metabolic diseases, but its role in astrocytes remains unclear. C57BL/6J wild-type and astrocyte-specific SCAP knockout mice were fed a high-fat diet and treated with streptozotocin to induce type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Behavioral tests and hippocampal histology were performed at 28 weeks. We investigated the NF-κB-C3 signaling pathway to elucidate how SCAP induces pathological astrocytic responses under diabetic conditions. Cognitive function was assessed in patients with T2DM using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and the mini-mental state examination (MMSE). We found elevated SCAP expression in the astrocytes of T2DM mice, correlated with cognitive dysfunction, impaired synaptic plasticity and altered astrocyte morphology. These effects were mitigated in astrocyte-specific SCAP knockout mice. SCAP elevation activates NF-κB by recruiting IκBα to the Golgi apparatus, promoting C3 transcription. Conversely, the inhibition of SCAP suppressed NF-κB activation. In patients with T2DM, serum C3 levels were higher in those with mild cognitive impairment, showing a U-shaped correlation with low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) levels. These findings uncover a critical regulatory axis underlying astrocytic dysfunction, where SCAP mediates pathological astrocytic responses via the NF-κB-C3 pathway, with the Golgi acting as the platform for SCAP-driven activation. Here we highlight the interaction between cholesterol disorders and pathological astrocytic responses, presenting SCAP as a potential target for therapeutic intervention in diabetes-associated cognitive impairment. Research Hypothesis Illustration: SCAP and complement C3 play a role in cholesterol-driven astrocyte responses in diabetes-associated cognitive impairment. Astrocytic SCAP expression is abnormally increased in HFD/STZ-induced diabetic mice, impairing neuronal synaptic plasticity by activating the IκBα/NF-κB/C3 signalling pathway. Upregulated SCAP in astrocytes directly binds to IκBα, increasing its activation in the Golgi apparatus, which promotes NF-κB nuclear translocation and triggers complement C3 transcriptional activation and inflammatory immune responses, ultimately leading to neuronal and cognitive damage.

To uncover new biological signals and therapeutic opportunities, we employed multiomic characterization combined with machine learning. APPROACH AND RESULTS: We profiled all anatomical CCA subtypes using whole exome sequencing, mRNA sequencing, and proteome/phosphoproteome analysis. Integrative dimensional reduction revealed RNA, protein, and phosphoprotein features driving tumor heterogeneity, enabling clustering. Machine learning algorithms identified molecular features for each cluster and mapped external datasets and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models onto these clusters. Kinase enrichment analysis highlighted targetable kinases active in each cluster. In vivo validation was performed in cluster-specific PDX models using the selective TNK1 inhibitor, TP-5801. We identified three molecular clusters with distinct pathway characterization: immunomodulatory (cluster 1), metabolic (cluster 2), and gene regulation/cellular fate (cluster 3). Cluster assignment was independent of anatomic subtype but correlated with overall survival following curative-intent resection. We also identified multiomic features and pathways linked to overall survival and lymph node metastases, crucial for patient treatment selection. Kinase enrichment analysis pinpointed TNK1 as a highly active kinase in the metabolic cluster. Treatment with TP-5801 significantly reduced tumor growth in a metabolic PDX model, but not in models representing the other clusters. Combining internal data with publicly available datasets, we identified the immunomodulatory cluster as most responsive to gemcitabine/cisplatin therapy, confirmed in vivo using cluster-specific PDX models. CONCLUSIONS: Integrated multiomic characterization provides translational insights by defining unique molecular subtypes associated both with therapeutic response and overall clinical outcomes. This approach identified TNK1 as a previously unrecognized therapeutic target in a defined subset of CCA tumors.	Hepatology (Baltimore, Md.)	2025 Sep 29

This review delineates current knowledge on the interconnected mechanisms underlying aging-related diseases, including atherosclerosis, obesity, sarcopenia, neurodegenerative disorders, rheumatoid arthritis, and cancer. We further discuss the critical role of contributing factors such as microbiome dysbiosis, sex differences, and exosome-mediated communication in modulating disease progression. Advancements in multi-omics technologies and AI-driven biomarkers, particularly epigenetic clocks, are highlighted for their ability to precisely quantify biological aging and stratify disease risk. Finally, we explore the therapeutic potential and promising clinical trials of targeting these shared mechanisms with senolytics, mitochondrial enhancers, and immunomodulators, offering a paradigm shift from disease-specific treatment to holistic interventions designed to extend healthspan.

Large trials are needed to assess safety and effectiveness. METHODS: For this open-label, randomized, two-by-two factorial trial at 20 sites in the United Kingdom, we enrolled participants with non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis who had frequent pulmonary exacerbations and daily sputum production. Current smokers and persons who had recently received mucoactive treatments were excluded. All participants received standard care and were also assigned either to one of three mucoactive-drug groups - hypertonic saline (the hypertonic-saline group), hypertonic saline and carbocisteine (the combination group), or carbocisteine (the carbocisteine group) - or to standard care alone. The comparisons were between hypertonic saline and no hypertonic saline and between carbocisteine and no carbocisteine, with each category consisting of two groups. The primary outcome was the number of pulmonary exacerbations over a 52-week period. Key secondary outcomes were scores on disease-specific health-related quality-of-life assessments, time to next pulmonary exacerbation, and safety. RESULTS: A total of 288 participants underwent randomization. No treatment interactions were found. The mean number of adjudicated fully qualifying pulmonary exacerbations over the 52-week period was 0.76 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.58 to 0.95) with hypertonic saline as compared with 0.98 (95% CI, 0.78 to 1.19) with no hypertonic saline (adjusted between-group difference in the means, -0.25 [95% CI, -0.57 to 0.07; P = 0.12]) and 0.86 (95% CI, 0.66 to 1.06) with carbocisteine as compared with 0.90 (95% CI, 0.70 to 1.09) with no carbocisteine (adjusted between-group difference in the means, -0.04 [95% CI, -0.36 to 0.28; P = 0.81]). Secondary outcomes and the incidence of adverse events, including serious adverse events, were similar across the groups. CONCLUSIONS: In participants with bronchiectasis, neither hypertonic saline nor carbocisteine significantly reduced the mean incidence of pulmonary exacerbations over a period of 52 weeks.

10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.125.074959	Single-Cell Splicing Isoform Atlas of the Adult Human Heart and Heart Failure.	Pan T, Lu L, Youker K, Shiau CK, Wang M, Lin HY, Nguyen A, He Y, Tong E, Zhu P, Ranka R, Yan Y, Sinha A, Bharat A, Eagar T, Wilcox J, Bhimaraj A, Gao R	BACKGROUND: Alternative splicing plays crucial roles in normal heart development and cardiac disease by influencing protein-coding sequences, functional domains, and molecular networks. However, a detailed characterization of the human heart isoform landscape remains incomplete. METHODS: Leveraging long-read single-nucleus RNA sequencing and computational analysis, we dissected full-length isoform heterogeneities, expression patterns, and usage shifts across cell types, cell states, and cardiac conditions of the adult left ventricle. We applied in silico approaches to assess the functional relevance of identified isoforms; validated isoform compositions of representative cardiac genes using reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction and targeted amplicon sequencing; and developed a web server for interactive navigation of our results. RESULTS: The data revealed that isoform heterogeneity is widespread in the cardiac cellular system, serving as a posttranscriptional buffer system that calibrates the molecule reservoirs in human hearts. In healthy left ventricles, ≈30% of cell type-specific genes were polyform, using multiple isoforms tailored to cell type-specific programs. Among ubiquitously expressed genes, >300 showed differential isoform usage with cell type specificity. Compared with heart failure, 379 genes in cardiomyocytes demonstrated marked isoform usage shifts, most of which are predicted to change protein coding outcomes through direct changes in protein coding sequences and switches between intron retention and non-protein-coding biotypes. In contrast, cell state-specific programs tend to operate on monoform genes associated with changes among cell states. In addition, our data revealed heart failure-associated differential isoform usage events in stromal and immune cell types in the cardiac microenvironment. CONCLUSIONS: We present a comprehensive atlas of splicing isoforms in the normal adult heart and heart failure through long-read single-nucleus RNA sequencing and comprehensive computational analyses. The results suggest crucial roles of isoforms in buffering core cellular programs and contributing to disease-associated cell states. The full-length details of these cell-specific isoforms serve as an important reference for downstream translational and mechanistic studies and are available on our online data portal at https://github.com/gaolabtools/heart-isoform-atlas.

However, acquired resistance can lead to a decrease in the efficiency of chemotherapy. Here, we show that cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) play a critical role in acquired resistance to chemotherapy. Treatment with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), oxaliplatin, or sn38 (an active metabolite of irinotecan) increased DKK1 expression and secretion, activation of MEK/ERK, and upregulation of p53 in CAFs. Knockdown of p53 or inhibition of MEK/ERK blocked the increase in DKK1 expression induced by chemotherapeutic agents in CAFs. Consistently, elevated DKK1 and phospho-ERK levels were found in CAFs isolated from surgically resected samples of patients treated with neoadjuvant therapy compared with non-chemotherapy controls. Treatment with recombinant DKK1 promoted the tumor immunosuppressive functions of CAFs, as noted by the increased expression of immunosuppressive cytokines and chemokines. Administration of 5-FU in vivo increased DKK1 levels in the plasma. Treatment with anti-DKK1 neutralizing antibody blocked 5-FU increased DKK1, repressed myeloid-derived suppressor cell (MDSC) tumor infiltration, increased NK cell tumor infiltration, and concurrently enhanced the antitumor efficacy of 5-FU.

Diagnosis of this affection currently relies on kidney biopsy, an invasive and complex procedure. This study explores the diagnostic value of biomarkers based in the urobiome - the microbial community of the urinary tract - in patients with renal SLE. METHODS: This study enrolled 585 female subjects including Healthy controls, non-renal and renal SLE patients. The taxonomic and functional differences of the urobiome in patients with SLE, as well as in the metabolites of interest, were identified by 16S rRNA profiling with PICRUSt functional inference and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). The accuracy of the identified biomarkers was tested by building random forest (RF) classification models. Furthermore, the results were validated in an independent cohort composed by 30 controls, 30 non-renal and 30 renal SLE patients. RESULTS: Bacterial gene-based biomarkers with an AUC value of 0.7 ± 0.07 and 0.67 ± 0.07 to distinguish renal from non-renal SLE cases were identified. These biomarkers were validated in a validation cohort using quantitative PCR (qPCR), demonstrating their robust diagnostic performance. Furthermore, our analysis uncovered significant urobiome dysbiosis and distinct bacterial functional profile in both groups of SLE patients, with notable differences in amino acid metabolism pathways, particularly those involving valine and leucine, which were assessed by NMR-based urinary metabolite quantification. CONCLUSIONS: Some bacterial genes have been identified in the urobiome of SLE patients that allow differentiation between those with renal and non-renal lupus. These findings offer valuable insight into the association between the urobiome and SLE presentation, and lay the foundation for developing novel diagnostic tools that overcome the limitations of current methods, thereby improving patient care.

10.1007/s10654-025-01304-y	Associations of alcohol drinking with incident dementia: a prospective study from	Chen Y, Yin X, Wang X, Zheng X, Yang X, Zhou J, Shi M, Zhang Y	Relationship between alcohol drinking and incident dementia remained uncertain. This study used UK Biobank cohort data to investigate the association between alcohol drinking and dementia risk, and potential effect modifications by cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk, APOE4 gene, and sex. We excluded infrequent drinkers and participants with baseline dementia or dementia within two years of follow-up. Drinking status was defined as non-drinking, low-moderate and heavy drinking (by weekly alcohol units). Drinking behaviors included drinking with meals and drinking type. Primary outcome was all-cause dementia. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated by multivariable Cox regression models. Subgroup analyses stratified by CVD risk, APOE4 gene, and sex were conducted. Among 296,715 participants (mean age 56.54 years), 4,242 developed dementia over a median follow-up of 13.7 years. Compared to non-drinking, low-moderate drinking reduced dementia risk (HR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.59-0.73), while heavy drinking showed no significant association (HR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.75-1.02). All drinking behaviors lowered dementia risk. Low-moderate drinking reduced dementia risk across subgroups: high/low CVD risk (HR 0.66, 95% CI 0.59-0.74/0.43, 0.30-0.61), APOE4 carriers/non-carriers (HR 0.71, 0.61-0.83/0.61, 0.52-0.71), females/males (HR 0.67, 0.58-0.77/0.63, 0.53-0.76). Compared with non-drinking, low-moderate drinking is associated with lower incident dementia risk, regardless of CVD risk, APOE4 gene, and sex. The protective effect of alcohol drinking was consistent among various drinking behaviors. Thus, this study confirmed the protective effect of low-moderate drinking in population, and provided insights for improving alcohol-related public health guidelines for dementia prevention.

10.1007/s10495-025-02175-0	Endothelial SPRY1 deficiency associates with angiogenic-metabolic reprogramming	Mo Y, Wang D, Deng Z, Zhao P, Gou Z, Sun X, Zhang Y, Bai Y	The mechanism underlying vascular remodeling in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) involves complex interactions among various cell types, with dysregulation of endothelial cells (ECs) homeostasis considered a crucial pathological factor. However, their local cellular changes still need to be fully identified during PAH. This study utilized single-cell RNA sequencing data from the GEO database to analyze lung tissue samples from PAH patients and normal controls, revealing significant heterogeneity in lung ECs and dysregulated metabolic pathways. We identified a significant expansion of capillary ECs in PAH patients, linked to dysregulated angiogenesis and glycolysis-tricarboxylic acid cycle metabolic pathways. Through integrative high-dimensional weighted gene co-expression network analysis (hdWGCNA) and machine learning, we identified SPRY1 as a novel key biomarker in PAH pathogenesis and validated its significant downregulation in a monocrotaline-induced PAH rat model. These findings establish capillary ECs expansion and SPRY1 deficiency as pivotal drivers in PAH pathogenesis, providing a foundation for precise therapeutic targeting.

Past observational studies have been hampered by selection bias and unmeasured confounding factors. This study aims to investigate the potential benefits of statin therapy in acute CES patients without established indications through a registry-based, randomized clinical trial. METHODS: This is a registry-based, multicenter, prospective, randomized, open-label, blinded endpoint (PROBE) study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of statin therapy in acute CES patients without established indications for statin use. Patients will be randomly assigned (1:1) to either statin users or non-users, with statin users receiving atorvastatin at a dose of 10 mg or higher throughout the study period. We plan to recruit 1036 participants to detect a relative risk reduction of 43% with 80% power and a two-sided alpha error of 0.05, accounting for a 10% loss to follow-up. The primary outcome is the occurrence of a major clinical event, defined as a composite of stroke recurrence, myocardial infarction, and all-cause mortality within 3 months after the index stroke. The secondary efficacy outcomes include (1) stroke recurrence, (2) all-cause mortality, (3) vascular death, and (4) major vascular events. DISCUSSION: This study will assist stroke physicians in determining the appropriate use of statin therapy for acute CES patients who do not have guideline-based indications.

10.1016/j.biopha.2025.118608	Immune cell dynamics and their role in cardiac injury: Mechanisms and therapeutic	Liu C, Wu R, Yang H, Yao Y	Cardiovascular injury initiates a temporally regulated immune cascade that governs both tissue damage and repair. Neutrophils, macrophages, dendritic cells, and T cells contribute distinct yet overlapping functions during acute inflammation, resolution, and chronic remodeling. This review synthesizes recent findings from single-cell transcriptomics, spatial omics, immunometabolism, and neuroendocrine-immune interactions to delineate immune cell dynamics across major cardiac diseases, including myocardial infarction, heart failure, viral myocarditis, hypertensive remodeling, and sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy. We further examine how immune cells communicate with cardiomyocytes, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and neurohormonal regulators to shape the myocardial microenvironment. Particular emphasis is placed on macrophage polarization, regulatory T cell activity, extracellular vesicle-mediated signaling, and metabolic checkpoints as key determinants of immune behavior. Based on these mechanistic insights, we propose a framework for precision immunotherapy that integrates immune profiling, metabolic status, and neuroendocrine cues to guide individualized interventions. Emerging strategies-including low-dose interleukin-2, immune checkpoint blockade, mesenchymal stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles, and immunometabolic reprogramming-are highlighted as promising means to recalibrate immunity toward tissue repair. Overall, this review provides a translational perspective aimed at shifting cardiovascular therapy from non-specific immunosuppression to adaptive, stage-specific immunomodulation.

Valiltramiprosate/ALZ-801 is a small-molecule potent inhibitor of Aβ-oligomer formation. The efficacy, safety/tolerability, and brain volume effects of oral valiltramiprosate were evaluated in this phase III, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center, 78-week trial in homozygotes with early symptomatic AD. METHODS: The study enrolled eligible APOE4/4 subjects aged 50-80 years with Early AD (Mini-Mental State Examination [MMSE] 22-30), which included mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and mild dementia, Clinical Dementia Rating-Global Score (CDR-G) of 0.5 or 1, who were randomized 1:1 to valiltramiprosate (265 mg twice/day) or placebo. The primary outcome was AD Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog13); the key secondary outcomes were CDR-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) and Amsterdam-Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL), and a secondary outcome was Disability Assessment for Dementia (DAD). The main imaging outcome was hippocampal volume on MRI; diffusion tensor imaging (MRI-DTI) assessed microstructural tissue integrity. Amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA) were monitored with MRIs every 26 weeks. RESULTS: A total of 325 participants enrolled and received study drug. At 78 weeks, the overall efficacy population did not show significant effects on ADAS-Cog13 or other clinical outcomes compared with placebo (ADAS-Cog13: 11% slowing; p = 0.607, N = 320), but showed significant slowing of hippocampal atrophy (18%, p = 0.017, N = 290).

10.1136/jitc-2025-012345	Targeting SQLE-mediated cholesterol metabolism to enhance CD8(+) T cell	Qiao S, Zou H, Weng Y, Liu YF, Li W, Yu XJ, Li L, Zheng L, Xu J	BACKGROUND: The sustained effectiveness of anti-programmed cell death protein-1 (PD1) treatment is limited to a subgroup of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) due to the tumor microenvironment heterogeneity, highlighting the need to identify targetable biomarkers that synergize with PD1 blockade. Abnormal cholesterol metabolism plays a critical role in HCC progression, along with growing evidence indicating its complex immunomodulatory effects within the tumor microenvironment. However, the interplay between cholesterol homeostasis and immune evasion remains elusive. METHODS: Transcriptomic and clinical data from HCC datasets were analyzed to identify cholesterol metabolism-related targets. Multiplex immunostaining and flow cytometry were applied to examine the immune landscape association with squalene epoxidase (SQLE) in human and murine tumors. Mechanistic studies were conducted in vitro, and co-culture experiments of tumor cells and T cells were followed by metabolomics and transcriptome analyses. Therapeutic efficacy was evaluated in mouse HCC models. RESULTS: We demonstrated that elevated SQLE expression in human HCC was associated with poor clinical outcomes and correlated with reduced CD8(+) T cell infiltration and activation. Pharmacological inhibition or genetic knockdown of SQLE in tumor cells promoted CD8(+) T cell proliferation and activation in co-culture experiments. Untargeted metabolomics identified 27-hydrocholesterol, an oxysterol derived from tumor cells, as a key factor impairing CD8(+) T cell function via cholesterol dysregulation. SQLE inhibition in tumor cells suppressed oxysterols secretion, therefore overcoming cholesterol restrictions and enhancing the immune responses of CD8(+) T cells. Moreover, SQLE targeting with terbinafine restored antitumor immunity and synergized with anti-PD1 therapy in HCC. CONCLUSION: Targeting tumorous SQLE restores CD8(+) T cell function by overcoming cholesterol restrictions via oxysterol-SREBP2 signaling, highlighting SQLE as a potential therapeutic target to enhance immunotherapy efficacy in HCC.

Cavidine (CAV), a natural alkaloid, has been shown to possess both anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties. However, further research is required to elucidate its role in CIPN and the underlying mechanisms by which it exerts its effects. PURPOSE: To examine the therapeutic efficacy of CAV in relation to CIPN, with a view to elucidating its underlying mechanism, which is associated with mitophagy and PKM2-mediated histone lactylation. METHODS: The post-CAV treatment assessment included the evaluation of mechanical allodynia, thermal hyperalgesia, and footpad immunofluorescence. To identify the regulated pathways of CAV, RNA-seq and lactate metabolomics were performed. The evaluation of mitophagy was conducted through the utilization of immunofluorescence, along with transmission electron microscopy. In addition, the analysis of histone lactylation at H3K18la was undertaken. The use of molecular docking and biolayer interferometry assay confirmed the interactions between CAV-PKM2. RESULTS: CAV significantly alleviated both mechanical and thermal pain, as well as peripheral nerve injury, in mice suffering from CIPN. Mechanistically, CAV suppressed PKM2 activity, reducing lactate accumulation and histone H3K18 lactylation. This inhibition promoted mitochondrial autophagy, evidenced by decreased LC3B-II, upregulated PINK1/Parkin, and reduced p62, and promoted the integration of autophagosomes and lysosomes. Molecular docking and biolayer interferometry assay demonstrated high-affinity binding between CAV and the allosteric site of PKM2. CONCLUSION: CAV alleviates CIPN by enhancing mitophagy via inhibition of PKM2-driven histone lactylation, thus providing a novel therapeutic strategy for CIPN.

Yu X, Huang C, Evers M, Liu J, Ting HJ, Zhang S, Chong SY, Tan MS, Wang S, Sayed N, Gao L, Muthiah MD, Soon GST, Wee A, Chow EK, Soh NJH, Pastorin G, Yu VC, Liu B, Dan YY, Torta F, Schiffelers R, Storm G, Wang JW	Increasing evidence implicates ceramides in the pathogenesis of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH). However, the therapeutic potential of liver-targeted ceramide lowering remains unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that elevated ceramide levels in MASH patients and mouse models are closely associated with the activation of hepatic de novo ceramide synthesis. The analysis of human hepatic single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) data revealed predominant up-regulation of SPTLC2, which encodes a subunit of the rate-limiting enzyme in the de novo ceramide synthesis pathway, in hepatocytes. By targeted inhibition of SPTLC2 with lipid nanoparticle-mediated siRNA delivery to hepatocytes, we reduced both hepatic and circulating ceramide levels. This intervention suppressed hepatic lipid uptake and lipogenesis, thereby alleviating MASH progression. Therapeutic efficacy was demonstrated in an 8-week methionine-choline-deficient diet-induced MASH model and validated in a 1-year choline-deficient high-fat diet-induced MASH model. Our findings highlight hepatocyte Sptlc2 as a promising therapeutic target for MASH.	Science advances	2025 Sep 26
10.1016/j.cub.2025.09.012	Reduced oxytocin signaling in the dBNST drives the transition from acute pain to	Fang S, Qin Y, Lian H, Zhong Y, Yang Y, Yu XD, Yang S, Liang J, Xiao W, Wen S, Zhang XM, Li B, Huang L	Transient sensory experiences can trigger sustained emotional disturbances, yet the underlying neural mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we show that acute pain induces persistent anxiety in male mice, independent of ongoing nociceptive input, through reduced oxytocin signaling in the dorsal bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (dBNST). Reactivating oxytocin receptors (Oxtrs) in the dBNST markedly alleviated anxiety-like behaviors following pain resolution. Mechanistically, chemogenetic inhibition of somatostatin-expressing (SST) neurons in the dBNST (dBNST(SST) neurons) abolished oxytocin's anxiolytic effects, while pharmacological blockade or selective knockdown of Oxtrs in these neurons increased anxiety-like behaviors. Transcriptomic and electrophysiological analyses further revealed that alterations in synaptic transmission and intrinsic excitability participate in this anxiety state. Together, these findings define a multilevel framework-spanning molecular, cellular, and circuit mechanisms-by which acute sensory input induces long-term emotional dysregulation. This study advances our understanding of pain-related affective disorders and highlights oxytocin signaling and dBNST(SST) neurons as promising therapeutic targets.	Current biology : CB	2025 Sep 26

Originally classified into 3 groups, the number of contributing genes is still increasing, underlining the need for a deeper understanding of the molecular interaction during intrahepatic cholestasis. METHODS: In the present study, we investigate the interplay of heterozygous variants in 3 cholestasis-associated genes (ABCB11, ABCB4, and MYO5B) by exploiting iPSC-based hepatic organoids from a patient suffering from recurrent intrahepatic cholestasis. RESULTS: Functional characterization of MRP2-mediated cholyl-lysyl-fluorescein (CLF) and BSEP-mediated Tauro-nor-THCA-24-DBD transport demonstrated a marked reduction of transport in MYO5B-deficient organoids, in comparison to unaffected control organoids. Moreover, iPSC-based organoids derived from the patient carrying 3 heterozygous variants in ABCB11, ABCB4, and MYO5B also exhibited absence of BSEP-mediated Tauro-nor-THCA-24-DBD transport, but functional MRP2-mediated CLF-transport. Interestingly, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated correction of the mutated ABCB11 allele could not restore the impaired BSEP function, suggesting the heterozygous MYO5B variant as the main driver of the transport deficiency. In fact, CRISPR/Cas-mediated correction of the MYO5B variant finally resulted in a restoration of the BSEP-mediated Tauro-nor-THCA-24-DBD transport. CONCLUSIONS: iPSC-based organoids serve as an authentic model for functional assessment of the hepatobiliary transport with fluorescent substrates. This allows the characterization of variants of uncertain significance and other variants in cholestasis-associated genes and revealed that a heterozygous MYO5B variant increases the susceptibility to defective hepatobiliary BSEP-mediated transport.

In a previous publication, our group defined some of the mechanisms that vitamin D analogue paricalcitol (P) and hydroxychloroquine (H) potentiated the effects of gemcitabine-based chemotherapy in PDAC. Based on this, we hypothesized that PH may potentiate 5-fluorouracil (5FU) and Oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy, and this may involve a novel mechanism of extracellular matrix (ECM) modulation. The combination of PH with 5FU+Oxaliplatin significantly increased the cell death, apoptosis, and S-phase cell cycle arrest as compared to untreated or 5FU + Oxaliplatin-treated MIA PaCa-2, HPAC and KPC cell lines. In vivo, the combination therapy inhibited PDAC growth and altered the immune landscape by activating T and NK cells. Proteomic analysis revealed significant reduction in ECM proteins, specifically integrin beta-4 (ITGB4). Confirmation of the role of ITGB4 was performed through genetic knockdown of ITGB4, which led ECM inhibition. In conclusion, the combination of PH significantly enhances the efficacy of Oxaliplatin and 5FU. We identified a new mechanism of action of PH through inhibiting ITGB4, leading to ECM modulation. These results suggest that the combination of PH with cytotoxic chemotherapy should be tested in PDAC clinical trials.	Cancer gene therapy	2025 Sep 27

However, studies exploring the underlying genetics of postsurgical pain remain limited. METHODS: This study was based on 17 025 individuals from the China Surgery and Anaesthesia Cohort. We used the Brief Pain Inventory to measure pain intensity prospectively after surgery. CPSP was defined as a dichotomous (yes, no) or continuous (based on pain intensity) variable across surgeries (abdomen, thorax, head and neck, limbs and superficial body regions and other body areas) at 3 months, and persistent pain at various postsurgical follow-up assessments. Genome-wide association analyses were conducted in 9022 individuals with genotyping data. RESULTS: We identified 16 independent genome-wide significant loci associated with CPSP. Multiple approaches, including gene mapping, annotation, and multiomics colocalisation, prioritised several potential risk genes, such as ASTN1, RSU1, and C1QL3, involved in neuronal migration, extracellular signal-regulated kinase/mitogen-activated protein kinase signalling, and synaptic function. The single nucleotide polymorphism-based narrow-sense heritability was estimated to be 13.7% (5.1-22.4%) for CPSP defined as a continuous variable. The polygenic risk scores of post-traumatic stress disorder, pain all over the body, multisite chronic pain, and opioid dependence were associated with CPSP at a nominal significance level. CONCLUSIONS: This study enhances our understanding of the genetic predisposition to chronic postsurgical pain. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR2000034039).

The role of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in immune regulation has gradually been recognized, although their functional mechanisms in T cells remain elusive. This study focuses on lncBADR (LncRNA Branched-chain Amino acids Degradation Regulator), elucidating its mechanism by which it regulates branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) metabolism to influence T cell effector functions. Mice with specific knockout of lncBADR (T cell(lncBADR-/-)) exhibited markedly ameliorated experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) symptoms. Mechanistic investigations revealed that lncBADR inhibits BCAAs degradation by binding to the enzymes Mccc1 and Pcca, leading to the accumulation of BCAAs within T-cells. This, in turn, activates the mTOR-Stat1 signaling pathway, promoting IFN-γ secretion and exacerbating EAE pathology. In contrast, knockout of lncBADR restored BCAAs degradation, significantly reducing IFN-γ secretion in T cells and suppressing their pathogenic functions. Further studies demonstrated that high-BCAAs feeding partially reversed the protective effects of lncBADR knockout, indicating that lncBADR plays a crucial role in autoimmune inflammation by regulating BCAAs metabolism. This study offers new insights into targeting lncBADR or modulating BCAAs metabolism as potential therapeutic strategies for autoimmune diseases.	Journal of neuroinflammation	2025 Sep 26

While host genetics and microbial composition have been studied, integrative analyses of the rumen-blood-mammary gland axis remain lacking. RESULTS: Here, we present the goat rumen microbial reference gene catalog and 5514 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) from 160 multi-breed rumen samples. Integrating this resource with lactation data from 177 Saanen dairy goats, we identify Prevotella spp. as keystone taxa driving concurrent increases in milk yield and fat percentage. Functional and metabolomic profiling reveals that Prevotella bryantii B14 synthesizes nicotinate, which is converted to nicotinamide in circulation. Using in vitro and in vivo models, we demonstrate that nicotinamide activates the mTORC1 pathway in mammary epithelial cells via GPR109A, which upregulates transcription factors SREBP and PPAR-γ and the downstream lipogenic genes FASN, ACCα, and SCD1 to promote milk fat synthesis. In contrast, the relative deficiency of P. bryantii B14 and the associated reduction in nicotinamide levels in the rumen of poor lactating dairy goats may represent a significant contributor to impaired lactation performance. Additionally, the enhanced hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis activity may also adversely affect their lactation phenotype. CONCLUSIONS: Our study establishes a causal link between rumen microbial metabolism and mammary lipid synthesis mediated by nicotinamide-mTORC1 signaling and identifies Prevotella abundance as a biomarker for precision breeding. These findings advance the understanding of microbiome-host crosstalk in lactation and provide actionable strategies for enhancing dairy productivity through microbiota-targeted interventions.

10.1001/jamainternmed.2025.4917	The Rise in Early-Onset Cancer in the US Population-More Apparent Than Real.	Patel VR, Adamson AS, Welch HG	IMPORTANCE: Rising rates of early-onset cancer have generated substantial media coverage and public concern. In response, early-onset cancer has become a federal research priority, and clinical guidelines have shifted to recommend earlier screening for some cancers. Yet, it remains unclear whether rising rates represent a true increase in cancer occurrence or that these may instead be explained by increased diagnostic scrutiny. OBSERVATIONS: In aggregate, the 8 cancers with the fastest-rising incidence (>1% per year) in US adults younger than 50 years (thyroid, anus, kidney, small intestine, colorectum, endometrium, pancreas, and myeloma) have doubled in incidence since 1992, while the aggregate mortality for these cancers has remained flat. Colorectal and endometrial cancer showed a slight rise in mortality; for the others, stable or declining mortality alongside rising diagnoses suggests that greater detection (rather than more disease) accounts for the trend. In some cancers, such as thyroid and kidney cancer, overdiagnosis is well documented. For others, incidental detection or earlier diagnosis may explain the trends. While not among the fastest growing (0.6% per year), breast cancer remains the most common early-onset cancer, and despite rising diagnoses in women younger than 50 years, mortality has decreased by approximately half. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The rise in early-onset cancer incidence does not consistently signal a rise in the occurrence of clinically meaningful cancer. While some of the increase in early-onset cancer is likely clinically meaningful, it appears small and limited to a few cancer sites. Much of the increase appears to reflect increased diagnostic scrutiny and overdiagnosis. Interpreting rising incidence as an epidemic of disease may lead to unnecessary screening and treatment while also diverting attention from other more pressing health threats in young adults.

10.3390/jcm14186445	Dyslipidemia Treatment in Patients with Acute Coronary Syndrome: Is It Time to	Brie DM, Mornoș C, Adam O, Tîrziu A, Brie AD	Dyslipidemia is a major modifiable risk factor in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS), and effective management is essential to reduce the risk of recurrent cardiovascular events. Recent guidelines emphasize early, intensive lipid-lowering therapy (LLT) and increasingly recommend combination regimens to achieve ambitious low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) targets. This review evaluates current evidence and recommendations for dyslipidemia treatment in ACS, with a focus on the rationale, timing, and selection of combination therapy. We conducted a comprehensive review of recent clinical guidelines, randomized controlled trials, and observational studies addressing lipid management in ACS. The analysis included data on LDL-C targets, efficacy and safety of high-intensity statins, adjunctive non-statin therapies (ezetimibe, PCSK9 inhibitors), and the impact of dietary interventions. Early and intensive LLT, initiated within 24-48 h of ACS, is associated with significant reductions in recurrent events and mortality. High-intensity statins (atorvastatin 40-80 mg or rosuvastatin 20-40 mg) are first-line, with combination therapy (statin plus ezetimibe and/or PCSK9 inhibitor) recommended for patients not achieving LDL-C < 1.4 mmol/L (<55 mg/dL) or >50% reduction from baseline.

We used a global multidimensional approach that integrates gender equity considerations, poverty, wealth shocks, income inequality and HIV infection rates to identify additional risk factors beyond those reported in 2024 report. This methodological framework aims to enhance equitable prevention strategies to mitigate the global burden of dementia. We demonstrate that adding four additional risk factors: poverty, wealth shocks, income inequality, and HIV, while also considering the influences of sex and gender will improve the global applicability of the 2024 report. This is important because, despite dementia primarily affecting women, 57% of the risk factors identified in the 2024 report are more prevalent in men. Our analysis suggests that incorporating these four additional factors could potentially increase the proportion of preventable dementia cases to about 65%. This approach would also reshape the understanding of dementia risk, indicating that around 56% of modifiable risks disproportionately impact women. Expanding risk models in this manner is crucial for developing equitable and effective global dementia prevention strategies, particularly in underrepresented regions. We present these considerations as enhancements to the Commission's significant work.	EBioMedicine	2025 Sep 25
10.1126/sciadv.adx5495	STK11 coordinates IL-4 signaling with metabolic reprogramming to control M2	Yang J, Singh N, Xu C, Kong D, Sharma S, Liu S, Lechner J, Lkhagva A, Tan H, Wu Z, Richer MJ, Zang Y, Huang X, Kapur R, Wan J, High AA, Zhang X, Wang X, Lu X, Yang K	Macrophages integrate microenvironmental cues to orchestrate complex transcriptional and metabolic programs that drive functional polarization. Here, we demonstrate that STK11 links interleukin-4 (IL-4) signaling with metabolic reprogramming to restrain alternatively activated (M2) macrophage polarization. Through integrative transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses, we identified STK11 as a key transcriptional and metabolic regulator during M2 polarization. STK11 deficiency enhanced the expression of M2-associated markers and promoted glutamine metabolism in IL-4-stimulated macrophages. Mechanistically, STK11 deficiency led to increased FOXO1 activation, thereby promoting M2 polarization. Pharmacological inhibition of FOXO1 or glutamine metabolism effectively reversed the enhanced M2 polarization. In an orthotopic model of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, myeloid-specific deletion of STK11 resulted in increased accumulation of M2-like tumor-associated macrophages, impaired antitumor immunity, and accelerated tumor progression. These findings uncover a previously unrecognized role for STK11 in modulating M2 macrophage polarization, offering mechanistic insights that may inform the development of immunometabolic therapies for pancreatic cancer.

10.1016/j.jbc.2025.110764	IRE1/Xbp1 promotes the clearance of poly(GR) dipeptide repeats in Amyotrophic	Li Y, Liu D, Li S	Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) are neurodegenerative disorders characterized by the expansion of GGGGCC (G4C2) repeats in the C9orf72 gene and progressive motor neuron degeneration. A key pathological hallmark of these diseases is the accumulation and cytoplasmic mislocalization of dipeptide repeat (DPR) proteins, particularly poly(GR), which are neurotoxic. Enhancing the clearance of poly(GR) represents a promising therapeutic strategy; however, the molecular mechanisms regulating poly(GR) turnover are not fully understood. Our previous work demonstrated that translationally stalled poly(GR) is targeted by the ribosome-associated quality control (RQC) pathway. In the present study, we identify the IRE1/Xbp1s signaling axis as an essential regulator of poly(GR) degradation. Ectopic expression of IRE1 or its downstream effector Xbp1s, as well as pharmacological activation of IRE1 using IXA4, significantly reduces poly(GR) protein levels in a Drosophila disease model, mammalian cell lines, fibroblasts derived from C9orf72-ALS patients, and a C9orf72 transgenic mouse model. Mechanistically, RNA-sequencing analysis reveals that IRE1/Xbp1s signaling upregulates heat shock protein Hsp70Ba, which plays a critical role in maintaining poly(GR) proteostasis. Additionally, we show that the Rictor/AKT/VCP pathway contributes to the translational regulation and turnover of poly(GR). Importantly, activation of IRE1, either through ectopic expression or IXA4 treatment, mitigates motor neuron loss in the C9orf72 mouse model. Collectively, our findings highlight the IRE1/Xbp1s axis as a key modulator of poly(GR) clearance and suggest its therapeutic potential in ALS/FTD.	The Journal of biological chemistry	2025 Sep 24
10.1097/MEJ.0000000000001270	Early diagnosis and treatment of acute heart failure in prehospital and emergency	Miró Ò, Chioncel O, Mebazaa A, Sato N, Butler J, Davison B, Biegus J, Pagnesi M, Ambrosy AP, Savarese G, Fudim M, Mentz RJ, Nauli SE, Lima IGCV, Bocchi EA, Sliwa-Hahnle K, Dzudie A, Harikrishnan S, Riccardi M, Zhang Y, Zhou J, Cotter G, Freund Y	Acute heart failure (AHF) is diagnosed in about 0.5% of all patients seen by emergency medical systems (EMS) and represents about 1% of emergency department (ED) visits. Leg swelling and shortness of breath are the most frequent patient complaints. Despite significant advancements in patient care pathways, the proper diagnosis, treatment and disposition of AHF may be further improved in emergency settings. The present document is an expert consensus document outlining key points in diagnosis, treatment and decision-making of patients being diagnosed with AHF by EMS and in the ED. Pillars of correct diagnosis include detailed clinical assessment and accurate interpretation of natriuretic peptides, while chest X-ray is still the most frequent image test used in ED, that could be substituted by ultrasonography exploration in appropriate patients. Quick identification of the most severe cases needing intensive care is mandatory, most of them characterized by hemodynamic instability, ventilatory failure or acute coronary syndrome needing intervention. Treatment could be started in prehospital settings by EMS, and loop diuretics are still the cornerstone of decongestive therapy. Measurement of diuresis and natriuresis shortly after provision of the first diuretic bolus is recommended, as it can help in detecting patients with poor diuretic response for dose augmentation or drug escalation with the addition of acetazolamide or thiazides. For selected patients, vasodilators (especially for acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema phenotype) or inotropes/vasopressors (for those with cardiogenic shock) can be needed. Oxygen therapy should be provided to patients with air-room SpO2 below 95%, and noninvasive ventilation is an option for patients with respiratory distress. After provision of ED care, a correct decision of patient discharge or hospitalization is paramount, and risk stratification can help in this regard. Other key points of AHF management in the ED include adequate diagnosis and management of triggers of the AHF episode; to take aspects of patient frailty into account; to avoid lines, catheters, and patient overstay in the ED where possible; and to ensure a proper follow-up plan after discharge from the hospital.

10.1007/s10522-025-10324-w	Multifaceted dynamics of circadian timing system influence aging and longevity.	Jagota A, Khan ZA, Sharma SA, Priyanka	Circadian time keeping system (CTS) consisting of network of central and peripheral clocks regulates physiological, metabolic, and behavioural processes in alignment with the 24 hour. Desynchrony between central and peripheral clocks contributes to the pathogenesis of age-related conditions such as metabolic syndrome, cognitive decline, immune dysfunction, and neurodegenerative diseases etc. Sex-specific susceptibilities further modulate circadian resilience, with hormonal changes and redox imbalances playing key roles in the aging trajectory. Immune senescence and hormonal dampening, particularly in cortisol and melatonin rhythms, exacerbate circadian misalignment, accelerating systemic decline with aging. Interestingly, aging and clock dysfunction is a bidirectional process, i.e. aging progressively influences circadian rhythms across multiple levels and vice versa, from the molecular architecture of core clock gene feedback loops to the functionality of the central pacemaker-the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN)-and its coordination with peripheral oscillators. This review critically highlights the complex alterations in circadian mechanisms associated with aging, including diminished transcriptional rhythmicity, epigenetic drift, mitochondrial desynchronization, and disruptions in neurotransmitter systems. Such changes in turn leads to weakened SCN output, impaired photic entrainment, and loss of temporal coherence across organ systems. Further, this review demonstrates CTS and aging at multiple levels such as behavioural, physiological, biochemical and molecular levels are linked in push-pull mechanism i.e., the breakdown in the harmony of circadian rhythms at systemic level pushes the organism towards early aging and aging in turn is linked to CTS disorders.

Anti-P cross-react with a neuronal surface protein (NSPA), alter glutamatergic synaptic transmission and plasticity in hippocampal slices, and impair spatial memory in a short-term passive transfer mouse model. NSPA knockout mice display spatial memory deficit linked to reduced NMDAR activity and postsynaptic density (PSD) levels, along with an increased membrane-associated tyrosine phosphatase PTPMEG, suggesting disrupted glutamatergic receptor trafficking. Here, we investigated the acute effects of anti-P on receptor cell surface expression and trafficking in cultured hippocampal neurons and their long-term impact on hippocampal components and spatial memory in anti-P( +) immunized mice. METHODS: NMDAR and AMPAR surface expression and NMDAR recycling were assessed in 21-24 DIV primary hippocampal neurons by immunofluorescence and FRAP using SEP-tagged receptors under the effects of rabbit anti-P IgG fractions. In vivo, female C57BL/6 mice were immunized with recombinant P0 ribosomal protein to induce anti-P, followed by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) intraperitoneal administration to breach the blood-brain-barrier (BBB). Spatial memory was evaluated with a water maze memory flexibility test. Hippocampal synaptosomal membranes and PSD-enriched fractions were analyzed by immunoblotting. Neuronal density, microglia and dendritic architecture were evaluated using Cresyl Violet, Iba1 and Golgi staining, respectively. RESULTS: Anti-P treatment of cultured neurons reduced GluN2A and GluA1 surface levels and impaired SEP-GluN2A and	Molecular medicine (Cambridge, Mass.)	2025 Sep 26
10.1186/s12911-025-03189-z	Developing an interpretable machine learning model for easily detecting insulin	Fu M, Peng Z, Yu X, Lv D, Wu M	OBJECTIVE: To develop and validate a classification model for insulin resistance in female individuals who have survived breast cancer using easily obtainable clinical and demographic features. METHODS: Data were obtained from the U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) spanning 1999 to March 2020. A total of 340 female individuals who have survived breast cancer were included, and participants were randomly assigned to a training set (n = 239) and a testing set (n = 101). Multiple machine learning algorithms were trained, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine. Model performance was evaluated using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and decision curve analysis (DCA). RESULTS: All models demonstrated strong classification performance in the testing set, with AUC values exceeding 0.87. Among them, the Random Forest and Support Vector Machine models showed superior performance in DCA. Of the seven input features-body mass index, fasting blood glucose, triglyceride, HDL cholesterol, poverty income ratio, race, and education-fasting blood glucose had the highest positive feature importance for classifying insulin resistance. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the feasibility of using machine learning algorithms to accurately predict insulin resistance in individuals who have survived breast cancer with a limited set of clinical and demographic variables. The Random Forest and Support Vector Machine models, in particular, offer strong classification performance and may support clinicians in early identification and management of insulin resistance among individuals in this high-risk population.

The successful development of these therapeutics relies on a comprehensive understanding of several key factors, including bioconjugation, bioanalytical techniques, biotransformation, tissue distribution, computational modeling and simulation, and clinical pharmacology. Bioconjugation strategies are essential for enhancing metabolic stability, facilitating cellular uptake, and targeting specific tissues, thereby improving efficacy and minimizing dosing. Tailored bioanalytical methods are crucial for assessing pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics, with particular emphasis on tissue PK in cases where plasma PK does not reflect therapeutic activity. Biotransformation and tissue distribution studies are essential, although a less comprehensive package may be adequate for well-established chemistry. Given the unique properties of oligonucleotides, computational modeling plays a critical role in predicting drug behavior in target tissues, supporting dose optimization. Clinical pharmacology for oligonucleotides is less complex than for small molecules, as they are less likely to interact with common drug metabolizing enzymes or transporter proteins. This white paper, developed by the Innovation and Quality (IQ) Consortium Nucleic Acids Working Group, consolidates industry insights and recommendations to inform best practices and regulatory guidelines, ensuring the safe and efficient development of siRNA and ASO therapies."

10.1016/j.celrep.2025.116318	ER stress tolerance is regulated by copper-dependent PERK kinase activity.	Bond Newton SE, Shi X, Beratan NR, Perhacs J, Arya JK, Bond MK, Gidalevitz T, Akay-Espinoza C, Brady DC, Jordan-Sciutto KL	"Pancreatic/PKR-like endoplasmic reticulum (ER) kinase (PERK) is a kinase that, in response to ER stress, mediates dual homeostatic and pro-apoptotic signaling. Thus, intricate regulation is required for physiological function. Attempts to modulate PERK activity have shown that the determinants of adaptive vs. maladaptive signaling remain ambiguous. Here, with purified protein, we provide evidence that PERK binds copper, identifies residues required for interaction, and demonstrates that copper is necessary for kinase activity. Furthermore, cellular PERK activity can be modulated via copper availability, and this regulatory relationship can be manipulated to dictate ER stress tolerance. Critically, these phenomena translate to phenotypes in vivo, as C. elegans harboring a ""PERK-copper mutant"" exhibit exacerbated ER-stress sensitivity. The copper-PERK paradigm suggests that copper homeostasis, as a regulator of PERK, may constitute a critical factor in resolving the long-standing ambiguity in endeavors to therapeutically target PERK."

10.1038/s41514-025-00268-3	Decoding skin aging: the role of KNG1 in collagen and elastic fibre degradation.	Zhang X, Yang X, Liu X, Huang J, Zhang Y, Xu X, Chen Q, Zhao S, Huang T, Zhang M, Zhang L, Wang X	Kininogen-1 (KNG1) is an important pro-inflammatory and pro-oxidant factor, but its precise role in skin aging remains inadequately elucidated. Quantitative 4D proteomic-sequencing analysis identified upregulated KNG1 in 3- and 15-month-old C57BL/6J mouse skin, with immunohistochemical staining corroborating its increase in intrinsic aging. KNG1 overexpression in murine skin reduced dermal thickness, collagen fibre content, elastic fibre density, aging marker Lamin B1, and increased oxidative stress marker 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), while KNG1 knockdown ameliorated these aging-associated phenotypes. Protein-protein interaction analysis revealed the underlying mechanisms. KNG1 regulates elastic fibre degradation through membrane metallo-endopeptidase (MME) activity, modulates collagen fibre degradation via matrix metallopeptidase 1 (MMP1) and matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP9), and elevates oxidative stress through epoxide hydrolase 2 (EPHX2). Thus, KNG1 may serve as an intrinsic skin aging biomarker, promoting collagen fibre degradation through MMP1/MMP9, elastic fibre breakdown through MME, and oxidative stress through EPHX2. KNG1 downregulation may represent a prospective anti-aging target.	npj aging	2025 Sep 26

This study aimed to evaluate the current occurrence rate of platelet transfusion in the ICU and provide an overview of platelet transfusion practices including indications for a platelet transfusion, thresholds, (non-)adherence and geo-economic region variations. DESIGN: International prospective cohort study. SETTING: Two hundred thirty-three centers in 30 countries worldwide. PATIENTS: All patients 18 years old and older, admitted to the ICU during a single study week, selected by each site from one of the 16 predefined weeks (March 2019 to October 2022), were included. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Of the 3643 patients, 208 (6%) received a platelet transfusion during their ICU stay and main indications consisted of active bleeding (42%, n = 187/443), prophylaxis (33%, n = 144/443) or an upcoming procedure (12%, n = 51/443). The median platelet count before transfusion was 44 × 109/L (interquartile range [IQR], 20-78) with variation by indication, including a higher median of 60 × 109/L (IQR 31-93) during active bleeding. A threshold for transfusion was stated in 51% (n = 224/443) of the events, with a median threshold platelet count of 50 × 109/L (IQR, 40-100). The advised threshold was not adhered to in 16% (n = 36/224) of cases, with the majority having active bleeding as indication. Contrasts in transfusion practices were observed across different geo-economic regions. Platelet transfusions were administered to 6% (n = 156/2520) of patients in high-income countries, 5% (n = 52/1069) of patients in upper-middle-income countries and in none from lower-middle-income countries (n = 0/54). Non-adherence was higher in the high-income countries (23%, n = 34/149) than upper-middle-income countries (3%, n = 2/75). CONCLUSIONS: Platelet transfusions were administered to a small proportion of critically ill patients, and were given to treat active bleeding or as prophylaxis in the majority of cases. Occurence rate, indication and threshold adherence for platelet transfusion widely varied between geo-economic regions.	Critical care medicine	2025 Sep 26
10.1016/j.phymed.2025.157292	Gut microbiota metabolite Urolithin B inhibits chondrocyte ferroptosis by	Li Y, Gu H, Jiang X, Li J, Li Q, Song K, Kong X, Meng Q, Shi A, Lin J, Chen B, Wang G, Zhang H, Xu Q	BACKGROUND: Osteoarthritis (OA) is a prevalent chronic disease characterized by articular cartilage degeneration. The lack of safe and effective therapies has made OA a leading global cause of disability, severely impacting patient quality of life. Urolithin B (UB), a bioactive metabolite derived from gut microbiota processing of ellagic acid, exhibits potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, positioning it as a promising therapeutic candidate for OA. However, the precise mechanisms by which UB inhibits OA progression remain unknown. PURPOSE: This study aimed to evaluate the therapeutic potential of UB for OA and elucidate its underlying mechanisms of action. METHODS: The therapeutic effects of UB on OA were assessed using interleukin-1β (IL-1β)-induced chondrocyte models and rats subjected to anterior cruciate ligament transection (ACLT). Integrated transcriptome analysis was employed to comprehensively investigate the relevant mechanisms. Fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3)-specific small interfering RNA (siRNA) and overexpression plasmids were utilized in vitro to validate the role of FGFR3 as a specific downstream target of UB and its functional significance in osteoarthritis progression. Furthermore, FGFR3 gene knockdown was performed in UB-treated ACLT rats to confirm the critical role of both UB and its downstream target, FGFR3. RESULTS: This study reports the novel discovery that UB significantly mitigates IL-1β-induced extracellular matrix degradation and alleviates OA progression through a previously unrecognized mechanism involving iron homeostasis regulation. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that UB inhibits chondrocyte ferroptosis by upregulating FGFR3 expression, which suppresses ferritinophagy by disrupting the interaction between nuclear receptor coactivator 4 (NCOA4) and ferritin heavy chain 1 (FTH1). Our findings establish the novel protective role of the FGFR3/NCOA4/FTH1 signaling axis in chondrocytes under inflammatory conditions by restoring iron homeostasis. CONCLUSIONS: We identified FGFR3 as a novel therapeutic target for the prevention and alleviation of OA. The validation of UB as a functional agonist of FGFR3, revealing its potential as a new therapeutic candidate and providing a new perspective for combating OA.

10.1186/s40001-025-03061-w	Association between trace metal element levels and ideal cardiovascular health in	Yang L, Shi J, Shen X, Tang J, Kasimujiang A, Dejite T, Deng Z, Yang T, Zheng Y, Liu C, Ma S, Shan X	"BACKGROUNDS: Adolescence is a critical stage in the development of cardiovascular disease. The American Heart Association has introduced a state-of-the-art algorithm called ""Life Essential 8"" (LE8) designed to quantify cardiovascular health (CVH). Research on the association of trace metal elements with cardiovascular disease in adolescents is inconsistent. This study aims to examine the association between trace metal elements and ideal CVH in adolescents. METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 5724 adolescents who participated in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) from 2005 to 2018. CVH was assessed using Life's Essential 8 (LE8) developed by the American Heart Association (AHA). Exposure factors were trace metal elements (iron, iodine, cadmium, lead, mercury, selenium, and manganese). RESULTS: More than half of the adolescents had non-ideal CVH and only 40.8% achieved ideal CVH scores. Of the CVH measures, high blood glucose (96.1%), body mass index (81.3%), blood pressure (77.4%), and physical activity (65.0%) had high proportions of ""ideal"" values. However, diet, lipids and nicotine intake had lower rates of achieving the ideal CVH criteria (26.9%, 42.6% and 47.6%, respectively). The results of regression logistic showed that iron and mercury were negatively associated with the occurrence of non-ideal CVH (adjusted ORs of 0.997 [95% CI 0.995,0.999] and 0.913 [95% CI 0.840,0.991], and that urinary iodine, blood cadmium, lead, and selenium were positively associated with the occurrence of non-ideal CVH (adjusted ORs of 1.432 [95% CI 1.054,1.945], 3.845 [95% CI 2.278,6.491], and 1.010 [95% CI 1.003,1.017], respectively). No correlation between manganese and CVH was observed. CONCLUSIONS: There is an urgent need to intervene in the CVH of children and adolescents. It is important to emphasize the need to maintain adequate iron intake while reducing iodine, cadmium, lead, and selenium intake."	European journal of medical research	2025 Sep 26

Cornelis MC, Caldwell JA, Vu THT, Hennigar SR, Berryman CE, Lieberman HR	"BACKGROUND: Some individuals exposed to traumatic stressors develop psychiatric disorders while others remain resilient. The Brief Resilience Scale (BRS) assesses the ability to ""bounce back"" from stress and is a widely used measure of trait resilience. We performed the first genome-wide association study of BRS in the UK Biobank (UKB). METHODS: Beginning 2022, a subset of UKB participants completed an on-line mental-health questionnaire that included the six-item BRS. BRS data and genome-wide typing and imputation were available for 124,774 participants of European ancestry. Genome-wide linear tests of BRS were performed, followed by SNP-based heritability and cross-trait genetic correlation analyses. Nominally significant loci (P < 5 × 10(-6)) were followed up for candidate gene mapping. RESULTS: SNP-based heritability of BRS was 7.3% and strong genetic correlations (r(g)) were observed with neuroticism (r(g), - 0.70 to - 0.44), depression (r(g), - 0.63 to - 0.37) and anxiety (r(g), - 0.81 to - 0.46). Three loci met genome-wide significance (P < 5 × 10(-8), near VRK2, TNKS/MSRA and RAB36) and 29 loci met nominal significance (P < 5 × 10(-6)). None of these were replicated in prior GWAS using different measures of resilience. The strongest candidate genes prioritized on the basis of both functional and biological evidence include VRK2 (2p16.1) (previously associated with neuropsychiatric disorders) and MSRA (8p23.1) (reduces methionine sulfoxide to methionine). Others at nominally significant loci include SLC6A9 (1p34.1) (encodes a glycine transporter), NPY (7p15.2) (involved in stress response), CADPS2 (7q31.32) (involved in synaptic vesicle exocytosis), and PCDH9 (13q21.32) (involved in neural tissue cell adhesion).  CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide further support for a genetic basis to trait resilience and one shared with psychiatric disorders and personality traits including depression, anxiety, and neuroticism. Our promising loci warrant replication but offer new biological insight to resilience."	BMC medicine	2025 Sep 26
10.1186/s10020-025-01347-7	YULINK deficiency promotes cell death under glucose restriction in HCC cells in	Wu YC, Hung TH, Wang WT, Kuo MW, Liang YJ, Kuo YR, Hou MF, Lai CS, Yu AL, Yu J	BACKGROUND: Through evolutionary genomics analysis, we identified Yulink (MIOS, Entrez Gene: 54,468), a highly conserved gene encoding an 875 amino acid protein with diverse functions in humans. Given the importance of accelerated glycolysis in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), we explored the expression and function of Yulink in HCC cells and analyzed clinicopathological data to unveil its impact on patient survival. METHODS: Clinicopathological data from 184 patients with resectable HCC were mined to establish a correlation between Yulink expression and patient survival. We employed reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) to assess Yulink expression in the tumor tissues. Various assays, including Western blotting, migration, MTT, cell cycle, immunofluorescence, oxidative stress, tumorigenesis, glucose uptake, glycolytic function, proximity ligation, and immunoprecipitation, were conducted on Huh7 cells to identify the regulatory mechanisms under glucose restriction. RESULTS: Comparative evolutionary genomics analysis revealed that patients with high Yulink expression had significantly shorter relapse-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) (P < 0.0001 and = 0.0015, respectively). Multivariable Cox regression analysis identified Yulink expression as an independent unfavorable predictor of RFS (HR, 2.63; 95% CI, 1.58-4.38; P < 0.001) in HCC. Furthermore, Yulink expression positively correlated with Huh7 migration and survival, especially in response to glucose restriction. Yulink deficiency enhanced glucose restriction-induced cell death, likely due to increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) and DNA damage, with a failure of ATM-CHK2 activation. Huh7 xenografts with Yulink suppression exhibited delayed tumorigenesis in immunocompromised nude mice. Importantly, proximity Ligation assays and immunoprecipitation demonstrated that Yulink colocalized and interacted with glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1). Knockdown of Yulink not only suppressed GLUT1 expression, but also disrupted GLUT1 translocation from the cytosol to the cell membrane, resulting in downregulated glucose uptake and glycolysis. CONCLUSIONS: Our results underscore the protective role of Yulink in HCC survival under glucose restriction and its pivotal function in glucose metabolism, suggesting a mechanistic link between lower Yulink expression and higher survival in patients with HCC.

It is important to accurately identify and target HIV-positive women at highest risk to develop CC for early therapeutic intervention. METHODS: A total of 2,134 HIV+ and HIV- women from South-West Tanzania were prospectively screened for cervical cancer and precancerous lesions. Women with cervical cancer (n=236), high- and low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL: n=68, LSIL: n=74), and without lesion (n=426) underwent high-resolution HPV genotyping. RESULTS: Eighty percent of women who were diagnosed with HSIL or LSIL were living with HIV. Any lesion, young age, HIV status, and depleted CD4 T cell counts were independent risk factors for HPV infections, which were predominantly caused by HR-HPV types. While multiple HR-HPV type infections were predominant in HIV+ women with HSIL, single-type infections predominated in HIV+ CC cases (p=0.0006). HPV16, 18, and 45 accounted for 85% (68/80) and 75% (82/110) of HIV+ and HIV- CC cases, respectively. Of note, HPV35, the most frequent HPV type in HSIL-positive women living with HIV, was rarely detected as a single-type infection in HSIL and cancer cases. CONCLUSION: HPV16, 18, and 45 should receive special attention for molecular diagnostic algorithms during CC prevention programs for HIV+ women from sub-Saharan Africa. HPV35 may have a high potential to induce HSIL in women living with HIV, but less potential to cause cervical cancer in single-type infections.	Frontiers in oncology	2021
10.1016/j.jare.2025.09.042	Therapeutic strategy for exosome-based bone regeneration to osteoporosis:	Dayanandan AP, Bello AB, Arai Y, Lee SJ, Lee SH	BACKGROUND: Osteoporosis (OP) is a progressive bone disease marked by reduced bone mass and microarchitectural deterioration, thereby increasing fracture risk. Current therapies only partly restore bone quality and often cause side effects with long-term use. Recent studies highlight exosomes, a subtype of extracellular vesicles, as key regulators of bone remodeling with promising regenerative potential. However, their role in osteoporosis remains underexplored. AIM OF REVIEW: This review aims to investigate how the established role of exosomes in bone regeneration may inform novel therapeutic strategies for osteoporosis. By linking general bone repair mechanisms with osteoporotic pathology, it evaluates the translational potential and limitations of exosome-based interventions. KEY SCIENTIFIC CONCEPTS OF REVIEW: Exosomes derived from mesenchymal stem cells, osteoblasts, osteoclasts, and macrophages regulate bone homeostasis by modulating osteogenesis, osteoclastogenesis, and immune responses. Their regenerative effects in non-osteoporotic settings are well documented. However, challenges such as exosome heterogeneity, rapid clearance, and poor targeting efficiency impede their direct application in osteoporosis. Recent bioengineering approaches, including osteogenic RNA or protein loading and surface modifications for bone targeting, show promise. Moreover, combining exosomes with immunomodulatory or synergistic therapies may further enhance their efficacy. Despite these advances, gaps persist in standardizing isolation techniques, ensuring batch consistency, and scaling up production for clinical use. This review consolidates current knowledge and outlines directions for adapting exosome-based bone regenerative strategies to osteoporosis treatment.	Journal of advanced research	2025 Sep 25
10.3390/ph18091261	Pharmacogenomics of Tirzepatide: Genomic Insights into Dual GIP/GLP-1 Agonist	Song Z, Tang Y, Peng M, Han R, He P	Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is frequently complicated by atherosclerosis (AS), with substantial overlap in their underlying pathophysiological mechanisms, posing serious threats to patient health. Tirzepatide, a novel dual agonist of glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptors, has demonstrated remarkable efficacy in glycemic control, weight reduction, and cardiometabolic improvement, making it a promising candidate for managing T2DM comorbid with AS. However, substantial interindividual variability in treatment response suggests a role for genetic determinants. This review systematically summarises current evidence on pharmacogenomic variants influencing the efficacy and toxicity of tirzepatide, explores the interplay between drug response genes and genetic susceptibilities to T2DM and AS, and highlights the potential of pharmacogenomics in guiding precision subtyping and individualised therapy. Finally, we highlight key challenges and future directions in the clinical translation of tirzepatide pharmacogenomics, aiming to inform personalized, genomics-guided therapy for cardiometabolic disease.

10.1186/s12872-025-05131-7	Endothelial activation and stress index and cardiovascular disease among American	Liu W, Xu X, Zhang M, Jin Y	BACKGROUND: Endothelial Activation and Stress Index (EASIX), derived from measurements of platelet count, creatinine, and lactate dehydrogenase, can serve as an indicator for systemic inflammation and endothelial dysfunction. However, the association between EASIX and the prevalence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in the general American adults has yet to be explored. This study aims to explore this potential association. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, participants from NHANES 1999-2018 were analyzed. To examine the association, multivariable logistic regression analyses and restricted cubic spline methods were conducted, supplemented by subgroup and interaction analyses. Statistical analyses were performed with R software (Version 4.1.3). RESULTS: This study comprised 38,794 subjects, with a prevalence of CVD at 10.4%. The median age was 49 years (range, 34-64), and 19866 (51.2%) were female. After adjusting for all covariates, elevated EASIX levels were associated with an increased prevalence of CVD [adjusted odds ratios (aOR) = 1.33, 95% CI: 1.26, 1.41], myocardial infarction (aOR = 1.16, 95% CI: 1.10, 1.23), angina pectoris (aOR = 1.15, 95% CI: 1.07, 1.23), congestive heart failure (aOR = 1.29, 95% CI: 1.22, 1.37), coronary heart disease (aOR = 1.23, 95% CI: 1.16, 1.31), and stroke (aOR = 1.16, 95% CI: 1.09, 1.23). A notable J-shaped association was observed, with a significant inflection point at 82.5, which was more pronounced in older subjects and those with hyperlipidemia. Furthermore, EASIX demonstrates the superior predictive capability for CVD, compared to other individual indices (AUC = 0.700, 95% CI: 0.691, 0.709). CONCLUSION: An elevated EASIX is associated with a greater prevalence of CVD in American adults. EASIX exhibited better performance in evaluating the associations compared to other individual indices. It is expected that EASIX can become a more effective metric for identifying populations at an early risk of CVD.	BMC cardiovascular disorders	2025 Sep 26
10.1016/j.disamonth.2025.102012	Multiple sclerosis updates and the safety and efficacy of Bruton tyrosine kinase	Prajjwal P, Patel PV, Patel ZV, Inban P, Patel D, Mahato P, Shamim L, Godinho NJS, Tekuru Y	BACKGROUND: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic neurodegenerative and autoimmune disease characterized by CNS inflammation and demyelination. Although current disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) can reduce peripheral immune responses, their impact on CNS-compartmentalized inflammation remains limited. Bruton Tyrosine Kinase inhibitors (BTKis) have emerged as promising oral agents targeting both B cells and microglia. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety profiles and effectiveness of two BTK inhibitors- Tolebrutinib and Evobrutinib in the management of relapsing multiple sclerosis. METHODS: A literature search was conducted using PubMed, Embase, and Scopus for randomized controlled trials published between 2020 and 2024. Studies comparing Evobrutinib and Tolebrutinib in MS patients were screened and evaluated based on predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Four relevant RCTs were matched and examined in more detail. RESULTS: On MRI, both BTK inhibitors showed decreases in gadolinium-enhancing lesions; Tolebrutinib demonstrated dose-dependent efficacy in reducing new Gd-enhancing lesions and T2 lesion counts, with optimal effects at 60 mg daily. Evobrutinib showed dose-dependent decreases in serum neurofilament light (NfL) levels and relapse rates, with twice-daily dosing providing greater BTK inhibition and clinical benefit. Nasopharyngitis, temporary increases in liver enzymes, and mild gastrointestinal symptoms were among the frequent side effects for both agents. The included studies did not report any direct clinical comparisons of CNS penetration or microglial modulation. CONCLUSION: With good safety and efficacy profiles in treating relapsing multiple sclerosis, both of the BTKis (Evobrutinib and Tolebrutinib) show promise. Both have promise as oral treatments of the future, but Tolebrutinib might have better effects on the central nervous system. To confirm long-term results and determine their role in progressive MS, more phase III trials are necessary.	Disease-a-month : DM	2025 Sep 26
10.3390/cancers17182999	Drug Repurposing for Targeting Cancer Stem-like Cells in Glioblastoma.	De Sousa-Coelho AL, Solaković B, Bento AD, Fernandes MT	Glioblastoma (GBM) is one of the deadliest types of cancer, characterized by a short life expectancy after diagnosis, mostly related to therapy resistance and recurrence. GBM stem-like cells (GSCs) reside within the tumor and contribute to these features; therefore, finding drugs that specifically target such cells holds promise to halt GBM progression. The primary objective of this work is to comprehensively review and discuss the potential of hard drug repurposing to target GSCs. Several studies evaluating drugs showing anti-GSC activity, originally approved for non-cancer indications, were identified. These mainly included antidiabetics (e.g., Metformin, Phenformin, and Sitagliptin), antihypertensives (e.g., Nicardipine, Doxazosin, and Prazosin), antimicrobials (e.g., Pyrvinium pamoate, Flubendazole, and Clofazimine), and central nervous system-acting drugs (e.g., Chlorpromazine, Fluvoxamine, and Disulfiram). Relevant candidates include those that disrupt GSC metabolism, namely impairing mitochondrial function, such as Metformin, Chlorpromazine, and Pyrvinium pamoate. Multiple signaling pathways may be involved, namely the Wnt, PI3K/AKT, and STAT3 pathways, among others. Also significant were those drugs tested in combination, resulting in increased sensitivity to Temozolomide (TMZ), the standard pharmacological treatment available for GBM. Some repurposed agents, such as Disulfiram and Metformin, have already reached clinical testing, although none have yet been incorporated into clinical practice. Importantly, major translational barriers remain, like limited blood-brain barrier penetration and the lack of robust clinical trials. In conclusion, drug repurposing is an affordable and suitable strategy to target GSCs, impairing cell viability, reducing stemness, and enhancing their sensitivity to TMZ, which has potential that should be further explored to improve patients' clinical outcomes.

10.1038/s41375-025-02776-3	Refining PET-based response in extramedullary multiple myeloma using total lesion	Zanwar S, Belge Bilgin G, Broski SM, Thorpe M, Bilgin C, Gonsalves W, Kapoor P, Kourelis T, Hayman S, Abdallah N, Binder M, Cook J, Dispenzieri A, Dingli D, Gertz MA, Leung N, Lin Y, Muchtar E, Warsame R, Kyle RA, Rajkumar SV, Kumar S	Positron Emission Tomography (PET)-based assessments are an integral part of response assessment in patients with multiple myeloma (MM) with extramedullary disease (EMD), yet their utility in EMD remains to be systematically studied. We retrospectively evaluated 95 patients with EMD undergoing FDG PET/CT imaging for metabolic response assessment using visual Deauville Scores (DS) and total lesion glycolysis (TLG). TLG responses were categorized as complete metabolic response (CMR; 100% reduction), major metabolic response (MMR; <100% to ≥50% reduction), and non-significant metabolic response (NMR; <50% reduction). The median progression-free survival (PFS) differed significantly by DS (22.4 vs. 4.3 vs. 2.8 months for DS ≤ 3, =4, and =5, respectively; p < 0.0001) and by TLG response (36.5 vs. 5.4 vs. 2.2 months for CMR, MMR, NMR; p < 0.0001). TLG offered better discrimination than DS, with approximately one-third of patients in each DS stratum being reclassified by the TLG stratification. In a multivariable analysis, TLG response [HR 2.6 (95% CI: 1.8-3.8), p < 0.0001] remained independently prognostic after adjusting for cytogenetics, triple-class refractoriness, and de novo EMD status. The 18-month OS rates were 89%, 42% and 19% for the TLG CMR, MMR, and NMR cohorts (p < 0.001). These findings support the integration of TLG into response criteria for EMD.	Leukemia	2025 Sep 28
10.1038/s41467-025-63285-6	Structural basis of antiphage defence by an ATPase-associated reverse	George JT, Burman N, Wilkinson RA, de Silva S, McKelvey-Pham Q, Buyukyoruk M, Dale A, Landman H, Graham AB, DeLuca SZ, Wiedenheft B	Reverse transcriptases (RTs) have well-established roles in the replication and spread of retroviruses and retrotransposons. However, recent evidence suggests that RTs have been conscripted by cells for diverse roles in antiviral defence. Here we determine structures of a type I-A retron, which explain how RNA, DNA, RT, HNH-nuclease and four molecules of a structure maintenance of chromosome (SMC)-family ATPase assemble into a 364 kDa complex that provides phage defence. We show that phage-encoded nucleases trigger degradation of the retron-associated DNA, leading to activation of the HNH nuclease. The HNH nuclease cleaves tRNA(Ser), stalling protein synthesis and arresting viral replication. Taken together, these data reveal diverse and paradoxical roles for RTs in the perpetuation and elimination of genetic parasites.	Nature communications	2025 Sep 26
10.1126/sciadv.adx2407	A sensory and motor neuropathy caused by a genetic variant of NAMPT.	Zhang Z, Pilch J, Lundt S, Zhang N, Chang Y, Singer T, Śladowski D, Hu XL, Zheng L, Ge WP, Zhang H, Li DP, Han X, Ploski R, Ding S	Nicotinamide phosphoribosyl transferase (NAMPT) is the rate-limiting enzyme in the salvage pathway for nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD(+)) biosynthesis in mammalian cells and is essential for survival. Here, we report on a previously unidentified axonal sensory and motor neuropathy likely caused by a homozygous genetic variant of missense mutation (c.472G>C, p.P158A) in the NAMPT gene. Two affected siblings presented with a range of clinical features including impaired motor coordination, muscle atrophy, foot deformities, and positive Babinski sign. Using different preparations including recombinant human and mouse NAMPT proteins, patient fibroblasts, and mouse model, we showed that the p.P158A mutation decreased NAMPT enzyme activity, leading to disrupted cellular bioenergetics, metabolic derangements, and increased oxidative stress. Moreover, the p.P158A mutation could cause synaptic dysfunction and motor neuron degeneration in the mouse model. This Mutation in NAMPT Axonopathy (MINA) syndrome is the first human hereditary neurological disease linking to an NAMPT variant. Our study has substantial clinical implications.

10.1038/s41467-025-63324-2	Hypoxic conditioning in Parkinson's disease: randomized controlled multiple	Janssen Daalen JM, Meinders MJ, Giardina F, Mathur S, Ainslie PN, Thijssen DHJ, Bloem BR	Preclinical evidence suggests positive symptomatic and neuroprotective effects of hypoxic conditioning in Parkinson's disease (PD). This study (NCT05214287) investigated the safety, feasibility, short-term symptomatic and downstream effects of hypoxic conditioning in individuals with PD. 20 individuals with PD (mean age 62, 10 women, Hoehn-Yahr 1.5-3) completed randomized controlled double-blinded multiple N-of-1 trials. Each participant underwent five different 45-minute hypoxia interventions in duplicate: continuous hypoxia at FiO(2) 0.163 and 0.127, intermittent (five-minute intervals interspersed with normoxia) at FiO(2) 0.163 and 0.127, and placebo. Primary outcomes were safety and feasibility as measured by adverse events, vital parameter disturbances, participant-rated discomfort and feasibility questionnaires. Secondary outcomes were short-term participant-rated and assessor-rated symptom scores. Exploratory indicators of target engagement were serum erythropoietin, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), neurofilament light-chain (NfL), platelet-derived growth factor-receptor-β (PDGFRβ) and cortisol. Secondary outcomes were evaluated using frequentist and Bayesian analysis. 20 participants completed the protocol. The trial met its primary endpoints for safety and feasibility. 95 adverse events occurred, including one moderate and three serious events. Adverse events were not dose-dependent and occurred at comparable incidence following hypoxia and placebo. Hypoxic conditioning was well-tolerated. Low-F(I)O(2) protocols caused significant oxygen desaturations in two participants. Participants considered longer-term application feasible. Intermittent hypoxia at F(I)O(2) 0.163 modestly improved most participant-rated symptoms for several hours compared to placebo, but not assessor-rated scales. One hour after intervention, serum markers did not differ between interventions. Hypoxic conditioning is safe and feasible in individuals with PD, and specific protocols may be associated with short-term symptom improvement. These findings inform and support follow-up studies of longer-term safety and efficacy of hypoxic conditioning.	Nature communications	2025 Sep 26
10.3791/64420	Imaging the Aging Cochlea with Light-Sheet Fluorescence Microscopy.	Santi PA, Johnson SB	Deafness is the most common sensory impairment, affecting approximately 5% or 430 million people worldwide as per the World Health Organization(1). Aging or presbycusis is a primary cause of sensorineural hearing loss and is characterized by damage to hair cells, spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs), and the stria vascularis. These structures reside within the cochlea, which has a complex, spiral-shaped anatomy of membranous tissues suspended in fluid and surrounded by bone. These properties make it technically difficult to investigate and quantify histopathological changes. To address this need, we developed a light-sheet microscope (TSLIM) that can image and digitize the whole cochlea to facilitate the study of structure-function relationships in the inner ear. Well-aligned serial sections of the whole cochlea result in a stack of images for three-dimensional (3D) volume rendering and segmentation of individual structures for 3D visualization and quantitative analysis (i.e., length, width, surface, volume, and number). Cochleae require minimal processing steps (fixation, decalcification, dehydration, staining, and optical clearing), all of which are compatible with subsequent high-resolution imaging by scanning and transmission electron microscopy. Since all the tissues are present in the stacks, each structure can be assessed individually or relative to other structures. In addition, since imaging uses fluorescent probes, immunohistochemistry and ligand binding can be used to identify specific structures and their 3D volume or distribution within the cochlea. Here we used TSLIM to examine cochleae from aged mice to quantify the loss of hair cells and spiral ganglion neurons. In addition, advanced analyses (e.g., cluster analysis) were used to visualize local reductions of spiral ganglion neurons in Rosenthal's canal along its 3D volume. These approaches demonstrate TSLIM microscopy's ability to quantify structure-function relationships within and between cochleae.	Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE	2022 Sep 28

10.1080/19490976.2025.2558071	Systemic and gut microbiome changes with metformin and liraglutide in youth-onset	Glaros SB, Mishra SP, Jain S, Davis FS, Gabel SA, Mueller GA, Jarmusch AK, Mabundo L, Courville AB, Walter MF, Walter PJ, Overdahl KE, Yadav H, Chung ST	Metformin (Met) and liraglutide (Lira) are preferred diabetes therapies that may improve glycemia by modulating the gut microbiome, but the mechanisms and pathways are unknown and few data exist in youth-onset type 2 diabetes (Y-T2D). In a 3-month parallel clinical trial in African American Y-T2D randomized to Met (n = 14) or Met+Lira (n = 11), we compared gut microbial composition and metabolomic profiles and determined the relationship of changes in microbial abundance with glycemia and plasma metabolites. After 3 months, Met was associated with greater relative abundance of Eubacterium and Eubacterium rectale and lower Bacteroides ovates (p < 0.05). Met+Lira was associated with greater Bacteroides fragilis and lower Streptococcus thermophilus (p < 0.05). Met group had increased (>1.5-fold) plasma cholic secondary bile acids (sulfochenodeoxycholic acid, nutriacholic acid, alpha-muricholic acid, and C24 dihydroxy bile acid; p ≤ 0.002). The change in nutriacholic acid correlated with lower fasting glucose (r = -0.7, p < 0.05). Shifts in microbiota taxa were not associated with plasma short-chain fatty acids (SCFA), hemoglobin A1c or glucose. Short-term Met and Met+Lira in Y-T2D were related to distinct shifts toward bile acid and SCFA-producing gut microbiota taxa, and secondary bile acid metabolites correlated with improved glycemia, suggesting bile acid pathways may be important modulators of glycemia in youth on metformin.Clinical trials.gov identifier: NCT02960659.

10.1136/jitc-2025-012230	Lactylation-driven MVP upregulation boosts immunotherapy resistance by inhibiting	Liu S, Pan Y, Liu W, Bu X, Shao R, Wang Q, Wu J, Wu C, Hu W, Xu J, Wu C, Jiang J	BACKGROUND: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a prevalent malignancy and the third leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have emerged as first-line therapies for advanced HCC, substantially improving clinical outcomes. However, resistance to ICIs remains a major therapeutic challenge. Lactylation, a recently identified post-translational modification, has been implicated in tumor progression, although its role in ICIs resistance in HCC remains unclear. METHODS: Cytotoxicity assays, flow cytometry and orthotopic HCC mouse model were used to evaluate the effects of lactylation in remodeling the immune microenvironment. Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing and RNA sequencing were employed to identify lactylation-regulated gene profiles. Programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) protein degradation was assayed by cycloheximide-chase analysis and ubiquitination assay. Interactions between major vault protein (MVP) and β-transducin repeat-containing protein (β-TrCP) were analyzed by co-immunoprecipitation experiments. Site-directed mutagenesis and truncation mutants were designed to determine binding sites of MVP-β-TrCP complex. RESULTS: Elevated lactylation correlates with poor prognosis and ICIs resistance in patients with HCC. Inhibition of lactylation enhances CD8(+) T-cell infiltration and cytokine production. Multiomics analyses identify MVP as a lactylation-regulated factor that suppresses CD8(+) T cell-mediated antitumor immunity. Elevated MVP expression is associated with resistance to checkpoint blockade therapy. Mechanistic studies reveal that histone lactylation-induced MVP upregulation stabilizes PD-L1 by preventing β-TrCP-mediated proteasomal degradation. Pharmacological inhibition of lactylation restores ICIs sensitivity in orthotopic HCC mouse models. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate that histone lactylation promotes ICIs resistance via MVP-dependent PD-L1 stabilization. Therefore, targeting lactylation in combination with programmed cell death protein-1/PD-L1 blockade offers a promising strategy to overcome immunotherapy resistance in HCC.

10.1007/s10142-025-01712-z	Cancer gene therapy: historical perspectives, current applications, and future	Zeng J, Luo J, Zeng Y	Gene therapy has emerged as a transformative approach in cancer treatment, leveraging genetic modifications to target malignancies with enhanced precision. Early efforts faced challenges such as inefficient vector delivery (< 5% tumor transduction rates with first-generation adenoviruses), immune responses (neutralizing antibodies in ~ 30% of patients), and limited clinical efficacy (< 10% objective response rates in 1990s trials). However, advancements in viral and non-viral vectors (e.g., AAVs achieving > 50% transduction efficiency in solid tumors), alongside CRISPR-Cas9 (90% target gene knockout rates in preclinical models) and RNA interference technologies, have revolutionized the field. Presently, gene therapy strategies, including tumor suppressor gene restoration, oncogene silencing, and immune modulation, demonstrate promising clinical outcomes. Despite persistent hurdles like off-target effects and high costs, emerging innovations in personalized gene editing, oncolytic viruses, and combination therapies signal a paradigm shift in oncology. This review explores the evolution of gene therapy for cancer, highlighting key milestones, current applications, and future directions that could unlock its full therapeutic potential.

10.1111/bph.70209	Oral administration of low-molecular-weight heparin ameliorates colitis by	Zheng D, Chen S, Feng H, Zhang S, Zhang C, Wang Y, Tan W, Qing Q, Liu L, Liu X, Wang Z, Liang L, Sun J, Chen Y	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Previous studies have reported that oral low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) ameliorated colitis by undefined mechanisms in ulcerative colitis (UC) patients. Our study explored the mechanisms of LMWH on colitis from the perspective of gut microbiota and its metabolites. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Dextran sulfate sodium (DSS; 2.5%) was used to induce colitis in mouse model, and LMWH was administered by either oral gavage, intracolonic delivery or subcutaneous injection to compare their therapeutic effects. Pseudo-germ-free mice was established by using antibiotic cocktail, and faecal microbial transplantation (FMT) was performed to verify the role of microbiota in LMWH actions. Alcian blue staining, fluorescence in situ hybridization of EUB338 and immunohistochemical staining were performed to evaluate the integrity of gut mucus barrier. Amplicon sequencing, transcriptome sequencing and untargeted metabolome studies were used to explore LMWH mechanisms. The ameliorating effect of indole-3-propionic acid (IPA) was verified in vitro and in vivo. KEY RESULTS: Oral, but not subcutaneous, administration of LMWH alleviated colitis and enhanced the gut mucus barrier. Pseudo-germ-free mice and FMT assays confirmed that therapeutic effects of oral LMWH were dependent on gut microbiota. Oral LMWH increased Firmicutes abundance and decreased Escherichia/Shigella abundance, subsequently increasing microbial tryptophan metabolites, especially IPA. The protective effects of oral LMWH were reproduced by IPA supplementation, with mucus barrier enhancing through regulating the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: The results provide new insights into the signalling mechanisms associated with the therapeutic potential of LMWH in colitis, and highlight the application of IPA for UC treatment.

10.1016/j.phymed.2025.157330	Astragaloside IV potentiates cisplatin sensitivity in triple-negative breast	Bai B, Zhang L, Zhang Y, Yue R, Lu Y, Shi R, Zhou Q	"BACKGROUND: Astragaloside IV (As), a bioactive tetracyclic triterpenoid saponin from Astragalus membranaceus, exhibits diverse pharmacological properties including anti-inflammatory, anticancer and immunomodulatory activities. However, its potential role as a targeted therapeutic agent for cisplatin sensitization in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) via the STING signaling pathway remains unexplored. PURPOSE: This study aimed to investigate the cisplatin-sensitizing potential of As in TNBC and elucidate its underlying molecular mechanisms. METHODS: Bioinformatic analysis identified key module genes from public databases using weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), followed by feature selection via least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression. Immune microenvironment characterization was performed using CIBERSORT deconvolution analysis. Potential targets of As in TNBC were systematically identified through multi-database mining, protein-protein interaction (PPI) network construction, pathway enrichment analysis and molecular docking simulations. Transcriptomic profiling revealed treatment-induced differentially expressed genes and enriched signaling pathways in murine tissues. The combinatorial anti-tumor efficacy was evaluated using orthotopic TNBC model (4T1 cell-derived) in vivo and 4T1, MDA-MB-231, and MCF-7 cell lines in vitro. Mechanistic validation was conducted through integrated in vivo and in vitro experiments. RESULTS: Integrated bioinformatics analysis (WGCNA, LASSO, and CIBERSORT) identified STING within a chemotherapy-sensitive module among six endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated gene co-expression networks. STING exhibited significant enrichment in antitumor immune pathways and correlated with heterogeneous immune cell infiltration. KEGG pathway analysis implicated immune/inflammatory signaling and DNA damage responses in the cisplatin-sensitizing effects of As. Molecular docking confirmed stable binding between As and STING (binding energy: -36.09 kcal/mol). In vivo, As synergistically enhanced cisplatin's tumor growth inhibition while mitigating cisplatin-induced toxicity, including weight loss, nephrotoxicity, and systemic inflammation. Transcriptomic and immunohistochemical analyses validated As-mediated DNA damage, STING pathway activation, immune cell recruitment. In vitro mechanistic studies using DNase I and STING inhibitor (C-176) demonstrated As potentiated cisplatin via cell cycle arrest, mitochondrial dysfunction and STING cascade activation. C-176 weakened the antitumor activity of As- cisplatin combination treatment. CONCLUSION: As synergistically enhances the therapeutic efficacy of cisplatin against TNBC while ameliorating its adverse effects, primarily through activation of the STING signaling pathway and potentiation of antitumor immunity. This dual mechanism-simultaneously boosting host defense (""Fuzheng"") and inhibiting tumor progression (""Kang`ai"")-provides a molecular basis for the observed ""Qi-tonifying"" properties of As in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), bridging TCM with contemporary immunopharmacology."

Whether ADSC-exo protects the liver via suppression of vascular endothelial cell (VEC) ferroptosis is unclear. METHODS: We evaluated the viability and migration of VECs and their ferroptosis-related indices. To further elucidate this mechanism, we examined the Nrf2/GPX4 pathway. Cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) was performed to establish a sepsis model to observe the protective effect of ADSC-exo. The death rate and liver tissue injury were observed. We also evaluated inflammation- and ferroptosis-related indices. Next, we examined the expression of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)/glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) pathway-related molecules to elucidate the underlying mechanism.

10.1038/s41467-025-63444-9	Synaptic vesicle endocytosis deficits underlie cognitive dysfunction in mouse	Vidyadhara DJ, Bäckström D, Chakraborty R, Ruan J, Park JM, Mistry PK, Chandra SS	GBA is the major risk gene for Parkinson's disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), two common α-synucleinopathies with cognitive deficits. Here we investigate the role of mutant GBA in cognitive decline by utilizing Gba (L444P) mutant, SNCA transgenic (tg), and Gba-SNCA double mutant mice. Notably, Gba mutant mice show cognitive decline but lack PD-like motor deficits or α-synuclein pathology. Conversely, SNCA tg mice display age-related motor deficits, without cognitive abnormalities. Gba-SNCA mice exhibit both cognitive decline and exacerbated motor deficits, accompanied by greater cortical phospho-α-synuclein pathology, especially in layer 5 neurons. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing of the cortex uncovered synaptic vesicle (SV) endocytosis pathway defects in excitatory neurons of Gba mutant and Gba-SNCA mice, via downregulation of genes regulating SV cycle and synapse assembly. Immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy validate these findings. Our results indicate that Gba mutations, while exacerbating pre-existing α-synuclein aggregation and PD-like motor deficits, contribute to cognitive deficits through α-synuclein-independent mechanisms, involving dysfunction in SV endocytosis.

10.1016/j.smrv.2025.102166	The effects of mandibular advancement devices on pediatric obstructive sleep	Li Y, Zhao T, Lin L, Zhang J, Liu S, Wu Y, Flores-Mir C, Hua F, He H	This umbrella review evaluated the effects of mandibular advancement devices (MADs) on pediatric obstructive sleep apnea (PedOSA). We searched six databases for systematic reviews published up to June 2025, that included children with polysomnography (PSG)-diagnosed OSA managed with MADs. The primary outcome was the change in the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI). Secondary outcomes included oxygen saturation and skeletal/dental changes. Twelve systematic reviews, including 7 meta-analyses, were included. Management with MADs resulted in a reduction in AHI and a slight improvement in sagittal mandibular position. However, significant heterogeneity was observed due to variations in device designs, treatment duration, and patient characteristics. Most findings were based on before-after studies, with limited randomized controlled trials, reducing the robustness of the results. The methodological quality of the included systematic reviews, assessed using AMSTAR 2, was predominantly low or critically low, indicating significant flaws. A corrected covered area (CCA) analysis revealed substantial overlap (20.7 %) in primary studies. While MADs show promise as an adjunctive therapy for PedOSA management in indicated cases, the low methodological quality of the included systematic reviews limits the strength of the evidence. High-quality primary studies and systematic reviews are needed to confirm the impact of MADs in PedOSA management and guide clinical practice.	Sleep medicine reviews	2025 Sep 11

As with other orthoflaviviruses-enveloped, arthropod-borne RNA viruses-host factors required for TBEV entry remain poorly defined. Here we used a genome-scale CRISPR-Cas9-based screen to identify LRP8, an apolipoprotein E and reelin receptor with high expression in the brain, as a TBEV receptor. LRP8 downregulation reduced TBEV infection in human cells, and its overexpression enhanced infection. LRP8 bound directly to the TBEV E glycoprotein and mediated viral attachment and internalization into cells. An LRP8-based soluble decoy blocked infection of human cell lines and neuronal cells and protected mice from lethal TBEV challenge. LRP8's role as a TBEV receptor has implications for TBEV neuropathogenesis and the development of antiviral countermeasures.	Nature	2025 Sep 24
10.1186/s13058-025-02118-2	AI-driven MRI biomarker for triple-class HER2 expression classification in breast	Wong C, Yang Q, Liang Y, Wei Z, Dai Y, Xu Z, Chen X, Du S, Han C, Liang C, Zhang L, Liu Z, Wang Y, Shi Z	BACKGROUND: Accurate classification of Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) expression is crucial for guiding treatment in breast cancer, especially with emerging therapies like trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) for HER2-low patients. Current gold-standard methods relying on invasive biopsy and immunohistochemistry suffer from sampling bias and interobserver variability, highlighting the need for reliable non-invasive alternatives. METHODS: We developed an artificial intelligence framework that integrates a pretrained foundation model with a task-specific classifier to predict HER2 expression categories (HER2-zero, HER2-low, HER2-positive) directly from dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI). The model was trained and validated using multicenter datasets. Model interpretability was assessed through feature visualization using t-SNE and UMAP dimensionality reduction techniques, complemented by SHAP analysis for post-hoc interpretation of critical predictive imaging features. RESULTS: The developed model demonstrated robust performance across datasets, achieving micro-average AUCs of 0.821 (95% CI 0.795–0.846) and 0.835 (95% CI 0.797–0.864), and macro-average AUCs of 0.833 (95% CI 0.818–0.847) and 0.857 (95% CI 0.837–0.872) in external validation. Subgroup analysis demonstrated strong discriminative power in distinguishing HER2 categories, particularly HER2-zero and HER2-low cases. Visualization techniques revealed distinct, biologically plausible clustering patterns corresponding to HER2 expression categories. CONCLUSIONS: This study presents a reproducible, non-invasive solution for comprehensive HER2 phenotyping using DCE-MRI, addressing fundamental limitations of biopsy-dependent assessment. Our approach enables accurate identification of HER2-low patients who may benefit from novel therapies like T-DXd. This framework represents a significant advancement in precision oncology, with potential to transform diagnostic workflows and guide targeted therapy selection in breast cancer care.

10.3390/nu17182979	Prenatal Vitamin D, Multivitamin, and Folic Acid Supplementation and Brain	van Rooij D, Mou Y, White T, Voortman T, Jansen PW, Buitelaar JK	BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Maternal vitamin supplementation (including folic acid, vitamin D, and multivitamin supplements) during pregnancy may lower the likelihood of neurodevelopmental disorders in offspring. This study examines the associations between maternal vitamin suppletion during pregnancy and morphological patterns in offsprings' brain structure and traits of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in a large population-based study of child development. METHODS: The study cohort included a total of 3937 children (aged 9-11) participating in the Generation R cohort in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. Maternal vitamin D and folateserum levels, multivitamin supplement use, and overall dietary quality (as assessed by the Food Frequency Questionnaire, FFQ) during pregnancy were used as predictors. T1 structural MRI scans were acquired and segmented using Freesurfer to assess brain morphometry. Cortical and subcortical brain volumes of children were separated into four independent components and used as mediators. ADHD and ASD traits, as measured by parent-completed questionnaires (Child Behavior CheckList and Social Responsiveness Scale, respectively) were used as outcome variables. RESULTS: Results show that (1) maternal vitamin D, multivitamin supplementation, and better diet quality were associated with fewer ADHD or ASD traits in the offspring; (2) vitamin D and diet quality were associated with larger-volume childhood brain components; (3) larger-volume brain components were associated with fewer ADHD and ASD traits; (4) part of the association between dietary factors in pregnancy and offspring ADHD and ASD traits was mediated through the brain volumes of the children. CONCLUSIONS: Though all observed effect sizes were small, further population-based research should be performed to further delineate the effects of gestational multivitamin and vitamin D exposure and investigate whether this may be an avenue for preventive interventions.

10.3390/biom15091219	Cannabidiol in Skin Health: A Comprehensive Review of Topical Applications in	Rusu A, Farcaș AM, Oancea OL, Tanase C	Cannabidiol (CBD), a non-psychoactive phytocannabinoid derived from Cannabis sativa L., has emerged as a promising multifunctional agent in dermatology and cosmetic science. The review provides an updated synthesis of CBD's topical therapeutic potential, challenges, and evolving regulatory frameworks. CBD exhibits diverse biological effects, including anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antibacterial, analgesic, lipostatic, antiproliferative, moisturising, and anti-ageing properties through interactions with the skin's endocannabinoid system (ECS), modulating CB1, CB2, TRPV channels, and PPARs. Preclinical and clinical evidence support its efficacy in managing acne, psoriasis (including scalp psoriasis), atopic and seborrheic dermatitis, and allergic contact dermatitis. CBD also relieves pruritus through neuroimmune modulation and promotes wound healing in conditions such as pyoderma gangrenosum and epidermolysis bullosa. In hair disorders such as androgenetic alopecia, it aids follicular regeneration. CBD shows promise in managing skin cancers (melanoma, squamous cell carcinoma, Kaposi sarcoma) and pigmentation disorders such as melasma and vitiligo. It enhances skin rejuvenation by reducing oxidative stress and boosting collagen and hydration. However, there are challenges regarding CBD's physicochemical stability, skin penetration, and regulatory standardisation. As consumer demand for natural, multifunctional skincare grows, further research is essential to validate its long-term safety, efficacy, and optimal formulation strategies.	Biomolecules	2025 Aug 23

Here we present CELLFIE, a CRISPR screening platform for enhancing CAR T cells across multiple clinical objectives. We performed genome-wide screens in human primary CAR T cells, with readouts capturing key aspects of T cell biology, including proliferation, target cell recognition, activation, apoptosis and fratricide, and exhaustion. Screening hits were prioritized using a new in vivo CROP-seq(2) method in a xenograft model of human leukaemia, establishing several gene knockouts that boost CAR T cell efficacy. Most notably, we discovered that RHOG knockout is a potent and unexpected CAR T cell enhancer, both individually and together with FAS knockout, which was validated across multiple in vivo models, CAR designs and sample donors, and in patient-derived cells. Demonstrating the versatility of the CELLFIE platform, we also conducted combinatorial CRISPR screens to identify synergistic gene pairs and saturation base-editing screens to characterize RHOG variants. In summary, we discovered, validated and biologically characterized CRISPR-boosted CAR T cells that outperform standard CAR T cells in widely used benchmarks, establishing a foundational resource for optimizing cell-based immunotherapies.

10.1038/s41467-025-63553-5	Ocular delivery of lipid nanoparticles-formulated mRNA encoding lanosterol	Song R, Lin Y, Zhang M, Liu Z, Zhang R, Zhao J, Li B	Cataract caused by crystallin aggregation is the leading cause of vision impairment and blindness globally. The only available treatment option so far is surgery. In this study, we leverage lipid nanoparticles (LNPs)-formulated mRNA encoding human lanosterol synthase (hLSS) to elevate lanosterol levels in the lens as a potential anti-cataract therapy. hLSS mRNA delivered with aromatized LNPs can be avidly taken up and translated into hLSS proteins in mammalian cells. mRNA formulations administered via intravitreal, subconjunctival, intracameral, or subretinal injection in rats display distinct kinetics and bio-distribution profiles, among which intracameral injection achieves sustained and selective protein expression in the lens. In comparison to clinically used LNPs, aromatized LNPs show more than seven-fold higher mRNA delivery potency in rats upon intracameral injection, without inducing significant ocular lesions. Furthermore, ocular delivery of hLSS mRNA-loaded formulations leads to elevated levels of hLSS proteins and lanosterol within the lens and a remarkable improvement in cataract symptoms in two rat models of cataract. Collectively, topical delivery of hLSS mRNA-LNPs to the eyes offers a potential strategy to reduce intracellular aggregation of crystallins and ameliorate cataract development.

10.1038/s41598-025-18383-2	FAERS based disproportionality analysis and network pharmacology investigation of	Lu J, Shen C, Ma W, Lin Z, Gao W	Doxorubicin (DOX) is crucial for cancer treatment but its use is limited by cardiotoxicity. Liposomal doxorubicin (Lip-DOX) was designed to reduce this toxicity compared to conventional doxorubicin (Con-DOX). This study utilized the U.S. Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database to compare the cardiotoxicity profiles of the two formulations through disproportionality analysis and to explore potential mechanisms using network pharmacology. We analyzed 10,695 adverse event reports for Con-DOX and 13,164 for Lip-DOX. Disproportionality analysis, measured by the reporting odds ratio (ROR) and 95% confidence intervals, demonstrated that Con-DOX was associated with a higher risk of cardiomyopathy (ROR 34.07) and cardiac failure (ROR 5.88) compared to Lip-DOX (ROR 18.39 and 3.80, respectively). Furthermore, Con-DOX generated safety signals for arrhythmias and myocarditis, while Lip-DOX did not. The rates of serious adverse events were high for both formulations (Con-DOX: 98.74%; Lip-DOX: 98.61%), with reported mortality rates of 26.21% and 23.15%, respectively, indicating no significant difference in the overall severity of reported cardiotoxicity or mortality. Network pharmacology analysis identified 113 overlapping targets associated with DOX-induced cardiotoxicity (DIC), which were refined to 10 core targets. Key enriched Gene Ontology (GO) biological processes included 'response to oxidative stress' and 'regulation of apoptotic signaling pathway'. Significant Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways encompassed the HIF-1 signaling pathway, EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor resistance, and the fluid shear stress and atherosclerosis pathway. Our study indicates the cardiotoxic profiles and underlying mechanisms of the two DOX formulations, providing valuable insights for drug safety monitoring and clinical practice.

10.1016/j.nbd.2025.107124	The potential role of misfolded wild-type SOD1 protein in sporadic amyotrophic	Marlow TR, Bowden KM, Collins MO, Shaw PJ	Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterised by the selective loss of motor neurons in the motor cortex, brainstem and spinal cord. In 1993, the first ALS-linked gene mutations were identified in the Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1) gene, which account for approximately 20 % of familial ALS cases. The mechanism of toxicity in this subset of patients is thought to arise from a gain-of-toxic function from the protein's propensity to misfold and aggregate into cytoplasmic inclusions. Immunohistochemical studies have shown that misfolded wildtype SOD1 (wtSOD1) is also detected in the motor neurons and glial cells of ALS patients without SOD1 mutations. It is proposed that disrupted, or aberrant, posttranslational modifications cause wtSOD1 to adopt a toxic conformation similar to that of the mutant protein. Subsequent mechanistic studies have shown that this misfolded wtSOD1 can disrupt cellular function and lead to motor neuron death through pathways similar to those observed in mutant SOD1-ALS. Given the limited neuroprotective treatments currently available that can effectively slow or reverse disease progression, targeting a pathogenic mechanism that features in both familial and sporadic ALS cases represents a promising therapeutic approach for a broader patient population. This review examines the growing body of evidence that supports or challenges the role of misfolded wtSOD1 in the pathophysiology of sporadic ALS and explores the potential implications of this mechanism in disease progression. Understanding how misfolded wtSOD1 contributes to disease pathogenesis provides new opportunities for developing more widely available treatments for this devastating disease.

10.1002/brb3.70896	Associations of the Monocyte to High-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol Ratio With	Meng Q, Zhang L, Fan S, Shen B, Zou C, Sun D, Liu X, Zhang J, Xu S	BACKGROUND: Monocyte to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio (MHR) is a biomarker of inflammation and metabolic disorders. However, the correlation between MHR and stroke is not well-studied. This study aims to examine how MHR correlates with stroke prevalence and prognosis. METHODS: We used cross-sectional and longitudinal methods to analyze data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) spanning 2009-2018. The subjects were divided into four groups based on the MHR quartiles. We evaluated the correlation between MHR and the incidence of stroke through weighted multivariate logistic regression and curve fitting. In order to test whether there were differences between the different subgroups, stratified analyses were constructed, and the capacity of MHR to predict stroke was assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Furthermore, we explored the connection between MHR and all-cause mortality by performing Cox proportional hazards models and Kaplan-Meier survival curves in stroke individuals. RESULTS: We had a total of 17,161 adult participants with a mean age of 49.07 ± 17.58 years of which 593 were diagnosed with stroke, with a prevalence of 3.46%. MHR was found to have a positive correlation with the incidence of stroke when fully adjusting for potential confounding variables. For each unit increase in MHR, the probability of stroke is elevated by 61% (OR: 1.61; 95% CI, 1.17-2.44, p = 0.022). Curve fitting analysis revealed a linear relationship between baseline MHR index and stroke (nonlinearity p = 0.963). Subgroup analyses indicated that most stratified variables did not significantly interact with the relationship between MHR and stroke, but the effect of MHR was stronger in individuals without coronary heart disease. Furthermore, weighted Cox regression analyses revealed that the odds of all-cause mortality 72% higher (HR: 1.72; 95% CI, 1.16-2.78, p = 0.027) for stroke patients in the highest quartile (Q4), compared with the lowest quartile (Q1) of MHR. Kaplan-Meier curves revealed that all-cause mortality significantly increased as MHR index values rose. CONCLUSIONS: In this cross-sectional study of US adults, MHR maintains a linear positive relationship with stroke. In addition, MHR can help predict long-term mortality in individuals with stroke. The analyses demonstrate that MHR may serve as an effective predictor of stroke and its mortality.	Brain and behavior	2025 Oct

Although dyslipidemia has been implicated in IDD pathogenesis, large-scale prospective evidence remains limited. This study aimed to investigate the observational association between serum lipid traits and IDD risk using data from the UK Biobank. METHODS: A prospective cohort study was conducted among 298,226 participants (aged 37-73 years; 54.2% female, n = 161,770) without IDD at baseline. Serum lipid levels, including total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), apolipoprotein A (Apo A) and apolipoprotein B (Apo B), were measured at enrollment. IDD cases were identified via ICD-10 codes. Cox proportional hazards models, adjusted for demographic, lifestyle, and comorbid factors, were used to assess associations between lipid levels and IDD risk. Restricted cubic spline analyses explored potential nonlinear relationships, and subgroup analyses examined effect modifications. RESULTS: Over a median follow-up of 12 years, 8,745 participants developed IDD. Higher levels of TC (> 5.64 mmol/L) and TG (> 1.51 mmol/L) were significantly associated with increased IDD risk. Compared with the lowest quintile, the highest TC quintile was associated with a 10.2% increased risk (HR = 1.102; 95% CI: 1.029-1.181; P = 0.006), and the highest TG quintile with an 11.3% increased risk (HR = 1.113; 95% CI: 1.036-1.195; P = 0.003), after full adjustment. No significant associations were found for LDL-C, HDL-C, Apo A, or Apo B after multivariable adjustment (all P > 0.05). Subgroup analyses revealed significant interactions between age and TG (P for interaction < 0.05), with younger participants (≤ 60 years) showing a stronger association. Additionally, age modified the effects of HDL-C and Apo A. These findings provide observational evidence that lipid traits may be differentially associated with IDD risk across age groups. CONCLUSIONS: Higher TC and TG levels were associated with increased IDD risk. These findings provide observational evidence for the role of lipid levels in stratifying IDD risk. Routine lipid screening may help identify high-risk individuals and guide early prevention strategies.	Lipids in health and disease	2025 Sep 26

However, progressive loss of CAR T cells contributes to relapse in many patients(2-4). Here we performed in vivo loss-of-function CRISPR screens in CAR T cells targeting B cell maturation antigen to investigate genes that influence CAR T cell persistence and function in a human multiple myeloma model. We tracked the expansion and persistence of CRISPR library-edited T cells in vitro and at early and late time points in vivo to track the performance of gene-modified CAR T cells from manufacturing to survival in tumours. The screens revealed context-specific regulators of CAR T cell expansion and persistence. Ablation of RASA2 and SOCS1 enhanced T cell expansion in vitro, whereas loss of PTPN2, ZC3H12A and RC3H1 conferred early growth advantages to CAR T cells in vivo. Notably, we identified cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1B (encoded by CDKN1B), a cell cycle regulator, as the most important factor limiting CAR T cell fitness at late time points in vivo. CDKN1B ablation increased CAR T cell proliferation and effector function, significantly enhancing tumour clearance and overall survival. Our findings reveal differing effects of gene perturbation on CAR T cells over time and in different environments, highlight CDKN1B as a promising target to generate highly effective CAR T cells for multiple myeloma and underscore the potential of in vivo screening for identifying genes to enhance CAR T cell efficacy.

10.1111/den.70042	Artificial Intelligence-Assisted Whole Slide Image Analysis for Lymph Node Status	Ichimasa K, Kudo SE, Kouyama Y, Takashina Y, Chung H, Maeda Y, Lwin WP, Toya Y, Hatta W, So JBY, Yeoh KG, Nemoto T, Misawa M	With the widespread use of advanced endoscopic techniques such as endoscopic submucosal dissection, an increasing number of early colorectal cancer (T1 CRC) and early gastric cancer (EGC) cases are now treated with endoscopic resection as the first-line approach. However, the risk of lymph node metastasis (LNM)-approximately 10% in T1 CRC and 5%-10% in EGC-necessitates additional surgical resection in high-risk cases. Current guideline-based risk stratification depends on pathological evaluation of the resected specimens to determine whether further surgery is needed. Yet both T1 CRC and EGC face shared challenges in LNM risk prediction, particularly in terms of accuracy and reproducibility. This review focuses on the latter. The diagnosis of key pathological risk factors, which serve as predictors of LNM, is subject to considerable interobserver variability among pathologists. One potential solution is the application of artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted whole slide image (WSI) analysis, which has been gaining attention in recent studies. AI-assisted models for LNM prediction in T1 CRC and EGC have shown encouraging results, suggesting that WSI-based AI could offer a pathologist-independent strategy to improve diagnostic consistency. However, the field remains in an early stage, with key limitations including small sample sizes and limited external validation. Additional high-quality evidence will be needed to support clinical implementation. Addressing challenges such as stain standardization and image artifacts will also be critical for achieving regulatory approval and broader clinical adoption.

10.1111/eje.12828	Concept map-based learning in an oral radiographic interpretation course: Dental	Gil YM, Lee BD	OBJECTIVES: Concept mapping is used to promote critical thinking and meaningful learning in health professions education. This study aimed to evaluate dental undergraduates' perceptions of concept mapping as a learning tool for oral radiographic interpretation competency. METHODS: A total of 39 third-year undergraduates at a dental college participated in the oral radiological interpretation session. The students received 1 hour of instruction before creating their concept map (CM). Participants were provided an assignment of four relevant clinical cases to draw an individualised CM. The students' draft and final CM were submitted. The instructor evaluated the CMs to identify whether students could analyse, connect and organise the information in a meaningful way. Among them, 37 completed the questionnaire about their experiences and responses to concept mapping. RESULTS: Students perceived concept mapping positively. The instructor's feedback helped them recognise their misconceptions and fostered greater motivation to learn. Students attempted to integrate basic biomedical knowledge and clinical features through cross-linking. However, they also expressed negative attitudes toward concept mapping regarding time consumption and heavy burden. CONCLUSIONS: Concept mapping motivated students' directed learning and gave them the opportunity to recognise their misconceptions. This study suggests the potential use of CMs as an adjunctive learning strategy in the oral radiographic interpretation class.

Current treatments, such as topical steroids, tacrolimus, systemic steroids, and phototherapy, often yield suboptimal efficacy, underscoring the urgent need for more effective therapeutic targets. To identify potential drug targets, we conducted multi-omics Mendelian randomization analyses using QTL data for 4,479 druggable genes in combination with vitiligo GWAS data from the GWAS Catalog and the FinnGen consortium. Among these candidates, CTSS demonstrated the highest therapeutic potential after comprehensive validation. Clinical samples and bioinformatics analyses revealed that CTSS was upregulated in melanocytes from vitiligo lesions and halo nevi. Single-cell and spatial transcriptomic sequencing further indicated that elevated CTSS expression was associated with increased infiltration of antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and CD8(+) T cells, and strongly correlated with immunogenic cell death (ICD). In vitro experiments confirmed that oxidative stress promotes CTSS expression via IRF1, leading to the release of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). In conclusion, oxidative stress-mediated CTSS upregulation via IRF1 may drive autoantigen exposure, DAMP release, enhanced antigen presentation, and APC activation, thereby triggering autoimmune responses and ICD, ultimately contributing to vitiligo pathogenesis. Inhibiting CTSS could offer a potential therapeutic approach for vitiligo.	The Journal of investigative dermatology	2025 Sep 24

Post-translational modifications (PTMs) regulate key oncogenic processes, but their comprehensive role in CRC progression and immune evasion remains unexplored. METHODS: We integrated multi-omics data from bulk RNA-seq (GEO/TCGA, n = 1,783), single-cell transcriptomics (41,143 cells), and Mendelian randomization. Differential expression, GSVA, and machine learning (LASSO/SVM/Random Forest) were used to identify PTM-associated signatures. Functional validation included spatial transcriptomics, and immune profiling. RESULTS: Multi-omics analysis identified dysregulation in 80% of PTM pathways in CRC, with ubiquitination sustaining Wnt/β-catenin signaling and GALNT6-mediated glycosylation driving immune evasion through PD-L1 stabilization and CD8 + T cell exclusion. Single-cell analysis revealed GALNT6-specific enrichment in immune-excluded goblet cells (p < 0.05). Machine learning derived a 5-gene PTM Activity Signature (CCNB1IP1, GALNT6, NEDD4L, PSMD14, UBE2C) that distinguish between patients with diseases and those without (AUC = 1.00). GALNT6 was validated as a causal risk factor (OR = 1.10, 95%CI:1.01-1.18), with its inhibition synergizing with anti-PD-1 to enhance CD8 + T cell infiltration (p < 0.01).

This study aims to investigate this relationship. METHODS: This study involved individuals aged 20 years or older who were not pregnant from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) between the years 2017 and 2020. MAFLD diagnosis was established by identifying the occurrence of liver steatosis through ultrasound transient elastography, along with the presence of one or more of the following disorders: diabetes mellitus (DM), overweight or obesity, or metabolic disorders. We evaluated the association between TyG index and MAFLD using multivariable regression analysis. RESULTS: Our study included 2966 participants with a mean age of 46.9 ± 16.5 years. As TyG quartiles increased, MAFLD incidence increased (P < 0.001). Full model adjustment indicated that TyG was independently connected with MAFLD (OR = 2.53; 95% CI = 2.13-3.00]), with the maximum quartile exhibiting the highest risk. In men, the TyG index and MAFLD exhibit a nonlinear J-shaped relationship (P = 0.042), whereas in women, the relationship was linear and positive (P = 0.204). This association was found to be more pronounced in Mexican Americans, those who were not overweight or obese, and among individuals without chronic kidney disease (CKD) (all P for interaction < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The TyG index was an independent risk factor for MAFLD. Individuals with various MAFLD components require individualized management.	BMC gastroenterology	2025 Sep 26
10.1016/j.tplants.2025.08.020	Phytohormones revisited: what makes a compound a hormone in plants.	Munné-Bosch S	Since the discovery of auxins as cell division factors a century ago, impressive scientific advances related to phytohormones have revolutionized plant sciences and human progress. This review examines the key features of the ten hormonal groups that operate in plants, here referred to as the 'classical ten': auxins, gibberellins (GAs), cytokinins (CKs), abscisic acid (ABA), ethylene (ETH), salicylates (SAs), jasmonates (JAs), brassinosteroids (BRs), peptide hormones (PEPs), and strigolactones (SLs). By leveraging historical data and sharpening the essentials of each hormonal group, their major functions are presented, with a discussion on what makes a compound a phytohormone and how it can be differentiated from hormone-like compounds and other signaling molecules. Hormonal receptors, long-distance transport, and differences between hormonal crosstalk, interactions, and complementation are discussed to illustrate the basics of hormonal action in plants.

10.1126/sciadv.adx7487	Development of SARS-CoV-2 as a viral vector: A novel intranasal bivalent vaccine	Xu J, Chamblee M, Jiang F, Kc M, Hsu CC, Thongpan I, Chen P, Zhang Y, Chiu CT, Shamseldin MM, Amer HM, Liang X, Amer AO, Boyaka PN, Cormet-Boyaka E, Peeples ME, Li J	Negative-sense RNA viruses have been widely used as viral vectors for vaccine delivery. However, little is known about coronaviruses as vectors for delivering vaccines. Here, we have developed safe SARS-CoV-2 Omicron JN.1-based live attenuated vaccine candidates by combining a mutation (D130A) in the viral nsp16 protein, deletion of the furin cleavage site (dFCS) in the spike protein, deletion of accessory proteins, and/or modification of the transcription regulatory sequences (mTRS). Subsequently, using rJN.1, rJN.1-D130A-dFCS, and rJN.1-mTRS-D130A-dFCS as the backbones, we generated three recombinant viruses expressing a nonfunctional, soluble, and stabilized prefusion F protein of human respiratory syncytial virus (RSVF). Among them, rJN.1-D130A-dFCS-RSVF virus was sufficiently attenuated and highly immunogenic, providing complete protection against challenge with both JN.1 and RSV in hamsters. However, rJN.1-mTRS-D130A-dFCS-RSVF was poorly immunogenic. Collectively, we demonstrate that attenuated SARS-CoV-2 is an effective viral vector for delivering RSV vaccine, warranting further development as a novel intranasal bivalent vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 and RSV.

This could reduce waiting lists and patient anxiety/discomfort and enable earlier treatment of colorectal cancer. The threshold used will affect how well faecal immunochemical tests work, with a higher threshold resulting in fewer referrals but a greater chance of missing disease. OBJECTIVE: What is the most clinically effective and cost-effective way to use faecal immunochemical tests to reduce the number of people without significant bowel pathology who are referred to the suspected cancer pathway for colorectal cancer, taking into consideration potential colonoscopy capacity constraints for urgent and non-urgent referrals?

10.1016/j.phymed.2025.157282	Butylchlorogenate from Chaenomeles speciosa alleviates ulcerative colitis via	Huang J, Liu Z, Liu Y, Liu X, Tian Z, Yao M, Wang W, Liu Z	BACKGROUND: Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the gastrointestinal tract. Despite the availability of traditional clinical treatments, their limitations highlight the need for alternative therapies derived from natural products that offer both strong efficacy and minimal side effects. Chaenomeles speciosa (Sweet) Nakai (CS), edible and medicinal fruit traditionally used to treat gastrointestinal disorders, has shown potential in UC management. However, the specific phytochemicals and mechanisms through which CS exerts its therapeutic effects remain poorly understood. PURPOSE: This study aimed to isolate and identify the bioactive compounds in CS, screen for the most potent compounds, especially chlorogenic acid derivatives, and assess their efficacy in treating UC. Additionally, we sought to investigate the underlying mechanisms of action. METHODS: The anti-inflammatory components from CS were separated and identified using various chromatographic techniques and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Compounds with potential anti-inflammatory activity were screened using the NO release assay and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Potential therapeutic pathways were explored through network pharmacology. In vivo, the therapeutic effect of the target compound, 3-O-(E)-caffeoylquinic acid n-butylester (BE), on UC was evaluated by monitoring body weight, disease activity index (DAI), colon length, histopathological scores, tight junction protein expression, and inflammatory marker transcript levels. Moreover, surface plasmon resonance (SPR) assay, gene knockdown, molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulations, quantitative Real-Time reverse transcription (qRT-PCR), and western blot (WB) analysis were employed to validate therapeutic mechanisms. The effects of BE on the intestinal microbiota and its associated metabolites in UC mice were further characterized through metagenomic sequencing and Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS). RESULTS: After preliminary activity investigation of isolated phenolic compounds based on ELISA, chlorogenic acid and its derivatives (BE and the novel 3-O-(Z)-caffeoylquinic acid n-butylester) were selected for CCK-8 assay and NO release inhibition. Among them, BE exhibited the most potent anti-inflammatory effects and was chosen for further intervention in UC mice.

10.1016/j.ejim.2025.106528	Effectiveness of tezepelumab in severe asthma: A multicenter real-world study.	Poto R, Manganello G, di Salvatore A, Capitelli L, Lagnese G, Messuri C, Muto T, De Michele F, Varricchi G	Severe asthma is a complex, heterogeneous disease that remains a major therapeutic challenge. Despite several biologics targeting type 2 (T2) inflammation, some patients remain uncontrolled, highlighting the need for upstream interventions. Tezepelumab, a monoclonal antibody against thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), has shown broad efficacy in randomized trials regardless of eosinophilic status or biomarker levels. We conducted a prospective, multicenter, observational study to assess real-world effectiveness and safety of tezepelumab in severe asthma. Thirty patients were enrolled at two tertiary centers in Italy between September 2023 and December 2024. Inclusion criteria were a severe asthma diagnosis per ERS and GINA 2024 guidelines and inadequate control despite maximal inhaled therapy. Tezepelumab was given at 210 mg every 4 weeks. Clinical, functional, and biomarker data were collected at baseline, 1 month, and 6 months. After six months, patients showed significant improvement in Asthma Control Test (ACT) score, with marked reductions in oral glucocorticoid use and exacerbation rate. Sinonasal symptoms improved over time. Blood eosinophils and FeNO decreased significantly, while total IgE remained unchanged. Lung function improved in both FEV(1)/FVC ratio and FEF(25-75), suggesting benefit on airflow limitation and small airway function. No serious adverse events occurred. Improvements were consistent in both T2-high and T2-low subgroups. This real-world study confirms tezepelumab's clinical effectiveness and safety in severe asthma. Benefits across inflammatory phenotypes support TSLP blockade as a broad-spectrum therapeutic approach. Larger, longer-term studies are warranted to confirm results and identify response predictors.

Following the reported crystal structure of the endonuclease domain from the avian influenza virus polymerase PA subunit, here we report the results of a systematic X-ray crystallographic analysis of its complex with adenosine, uridine, and thymidine nucleoside monophosphates (NMPs). Electron density corresponding to the monophosphate moiety of each nucleotide was apparent in each NMP complex and bound to the catalytic metal. A hydrophobic site was found to contribute to nucleoside binding. The NMP complex structures should represent the conformation of the bound product after nuclease cleavage. Moreover, one solvent molecule was found to occupy an equivalent position to the second reported Mn(2+) ion, where it mediates the interaction between bound NMPs and the N-terminal PA domain in the presence of the Mg(2+) ion. The results presented here indicate a possible cleavage mechanism and identify a distinct nucleotide binding pocket. The identification of this binding pocket opens a new avenue for anti-influenza drug discovery, targeting the cap-dependent endonuclease, in response to the worldwide threat of influenza.

10.1016/j.repbio.2025.101081	Metformin-loaded Chitosan nanoparticles alleviate insulin resistance in the	Issa SM, Thabet EH, Dief AE, Omar W, Saleh SR, Essawy MM, El Eter E	Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common disorder in females characterized by insulin resistance (IR), hyperandrogenemia and anovulation. The etiology of PCOS is unknown. However, disrupted phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and protein kinase B/AKT signaling pathway may be a possible cause of IR in PCOS. Metformin can activate AKT via PI3K and improve IR. However, metformin alone has shown conflicting results. Chitosan nanoparticles (CSNPs) are natural nano-carriers with anti-diabetic effects. Therefore, we aimed to elucidate the therapeutic potential of metformin-loaded CSNPs (CSNPs-Met) in a letrozole-induced PCOS rat model. The study comprised five groups of rats: control, PCOS, PCOS plus metformin, PCOS plus CSNPs, and PCOS plus CSNPs-Met. Letrozole was found to successfully induce PCOS, as evidenced by elevated serum testosterone levels, homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), an increased number of cystic follicles, fewer corpora lutea and a disturbed estrus cycle. The pAKT and GLUT4 protein levels were significantly lower in ovarian and muscular tissues than in control group (P < 0.001), suggesting impaired insulin signaling and glucose transport that may contribute to both the metabolic and reproductive disturbances. CSNP-Met showed a significant decrease in testosterone, HOMA-IR, cystic follicles with an increase in the number of corpora lutea, as well as the levels of pAKT and GLUT4 in ovarian and muscular tissues (P < 0.001). In addition, the estrus cycle was restored to normal levels. Hence, CSNPs-Met showed superior efficacy in ameliorating PCOS-associated parameters relative to metformin alone. In addition, these results support future translational studies to explore the clinical applicability of CSNPs in PCOS management.	Reproductive biology	2025 Sep 26
10.1002/ana.78046	Skeletal Muscle Biomarkers of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis: A Large-Scale,	Dergai O, Wuu J, Koziczak-Holbro M, Malaspina A, Granit V, Hernandez JP, Cooley A, Sachdev R, Yu L, Bidinosti M, Flotte L, Nash M, Jennings LL, Berry JD, Bruijn LI, Brachat S, Benatar M	OBJECTIVE: Biomarkers with clear contexts of use are important tools for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) therapy development. Understanding their longitudinal trajectory in the untreated state is key to their use as potential markers of pharmacodynamic response. To this end, we undertook a large-scale proteomic study in well-phenotyped cohorts to identify biomarker candidates of ALS disease state and disease progression. METHODS: Clinical phenotypic data and biofluid samples, collected from patients with ALS and healthy controls through multiple longitudinal natural history studies, were used to identify biomarker candidates. Slow off-rate modified aptamer (SOMAmer)-based relatively quantitative measurement of ~7,000 proteins was performed in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), with immunoassay validation of candidates of interest. RESULTS: We identified 329 plasma proteins significantly differentially regulated between ALS and controls (adjusted p-value <0.05), with 25 showing >40% relative abundance. PDLIM3, TNNT2, and MYL11 had the greatest log-fold elevation, whereas ANTXR2 and ART3 had the greatest log-fold reduction. A similar set of plasma proteins was found to increase (eg, PDLIM3, TNNT2, and MYL11) or decrease (eg, ANTXR2, ART3, and MSTN) with disease progression. CSF proteins with the greatest log-fold elevation included NEFL, NEFH, CHIT1, CA3, MYL11, and GPNMB. These results were confirmed in an independent replication cohort. Moreover, tissue-specific signature enrichment suggests a significant contribution of muscle as a source of these biomarkers. Plasma KCNIP3 was elevated by ~60% in those on riluzole. Immunoassays provided orthogonal validation of plasma TNNT2 and CSF GPNMB. INTERPRETATION: We identified an array of novel biomarkers with the potential to serve as response biomarkers to aid therapy development, as well as to shed light on the underlying biology of disease.

10.1186/s12894-025-01919-z	Comparative real-world study of apalutamide and darolutamide in Japanese patients	Ikeda M, Uemura K, Ito Y, Ito H, Kawahara T, Hasumi H, Teranishi JI, Makiyama K, Uemura H	BACKGROUND: Non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (nmCRPC) is often asymptomatic but carries a risk of progression to metastatic disease. Apalutamide (APA) and darolutamide (DARO) have been shown to improve metastasis-free survival (MFS). This study evaluated the real-world efficacy and safety of APA and DARO in Japanese patients with nmCRPC. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 67 nmCRPC patients treated with APA (n = 32) or DARO (n = 35). Outcomes included time to treatment discontinuation or mCRPC progression, time to mCRPC, PSA response rate, treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs), post-mCRPC treatment patterns, and predictors of progression. RESULTS: In patients with prostate-specific antigen doubling time (PSADT) < 10 months, no significant difference was observed between the APA and DARO groups in the time to progression to mCRPC. PSA response and MFS were comparable between groups. TRAEs were significantly more frequent with APA (75.0% vs. 25.7%), with rash being the most common. High PSA at treatment initiation (≥ 3.6 ng/mL) and PSA response < 90% were independent predictors of progression. Abiraterone was the most common first-line agent after mCRPC. CONCLUSIONS: DARO was associated with a lower incidence of TRAEs compared to APA. Rash was more prevalent with APA. Elevated baseline PSA and suboptimal PSA response were associated with progression.

10.3390/cancers17183027	CAR-T Cell Therapies in B-Cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia: Emerging Data and	Alati C, Pitea M, Molica M, Scalise L, Porto G, Bilardi E, Lazzaro G, Micò MC, Pugliese M, Canale FA, Loteta B, Naso V, Policastro G, Utano G, Rizzuto A, Marafioti V, Rossi M, Martino M	CAR-T therapy has transformed the treatment of relapsed or refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), particularly in pediatric and young adult patients. Many studies report one-year overall survival rates of between 60% and 80% following therapy. Event-free survival rates at one year are around 50-70%, with 40-50% of patients in remission after two years. Despite these impressive results, disease relapse remains a problem. Future CAR-T cell platforms should target multiple antigens, and the optimal design of such constructs must be determined. Modern trials should explore the role of CAR-T cell therapy as a consolidation treatment for patients with high-risk ALL, including those with persistent minimal residual disease at the end of induction/consolidation therapy, an IKZF1-positive gene expression profile, or a TP53 mutation or Ph-like gene expression profile. Improving the efficiency of gene-editing methods could lead to higher success rates in creating CAR-T cells, as well as reducing manufacturing time and costs. Producing universal CAR-T cells from healthy donors could significantly reduce production time and costs. These issues underscore the dynamic and evolving nature of B-ALL research. Ongoing studies and clinical trials are addressing many of these challenges in order to improve outcomes for B-ALL patients and expand the applications of CAR-T cell therapy.	Cancers	2025 Sep 16
10.1007/s00415-025-13383-8	Association of alcohol responsiveness and non-motor symptoms in isolated	Junker J, Berman BD, König IR, Vidailhet M, Roze E, Perlmutter JS, Jinnah HA, Brüggemann N	OBJECTIVE: About 30% of patients with isolated adult-onset dystonia report an improvement of their motor symptoms after the consumption of alcohol. In this cross-sectional study, we sought to investigate whether the observed improvement is attributable to the anxiolytic, euphoric, and analgesic properties of alcohol, rather than or in addition to its effect on dystonic movements, as psychiatric symptoms and pain frequently occur in dystonia patients and as emotional stress is a well-established trigger for symptom exacerbation. METHODS: We analyzed data from 339 prospectively enrolled participants with recently diagnosed isolated dystonia (mean age: 55.2 ± 12.5 years, 228 female) of the Natural History Project of the Dystonia Coalition, a large international multicenter study. Alcohol responsiveness was determined by patients´ self-report. Symptoms of depression, as well as generalized and social anxiety, were assessed using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale. Severity of pain was measured using question 21 of the RAND 36-Item Health Survey. RESULTS: Participants with more severe pain reported greater response to alcohol than those with less severe pain (p = .004), whereas symptoms of depression (p = .986), generalized anxiety (p = .395) and social anxiety (p = .953) were not associated. CONCLUSION: Alcohol responsiveness in isolated dystonia is associated with higher levels of pain, whereas self-reported alcohol-related improvements in dystonic movements or tremor do not depend on the euphoric or anxiolytic effects of alcohol. This finding underscores the potential role of pain management in alleviating motor symptoms in dystonia.	Journal of neurology	2025 Sep 29
10.1016/j.ijgc.2025.102135	Psychophysical and social impact of risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy in China:	Ha X, Feng Z, Xia J, Liu Z, Wang J, Ke Z, Lin Y, Chen Y, Wen H, Wu X	OBJECTIVE: Risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy has been adopted in China as an effective preventive measure against ovarian cancer, particularly for individuals with breast cancer gene (BRCA) mutations. While the procedure's efficacy in reducing ovarian cancer risk is well established, the associated psychophysical and social impacts have received limited attention. Understanding these impacts is critical for enhancing patient care and improving quality of life. METHODS: This retrospective study included 154 BRCA mutation carriers who underwent risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy at Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center between October 2016 and March 2024. A total of 136 patients were successfully followed up for quality-of-life assessment. Data were collected using the Self-Rating Anxiety Scale, Menopause Rating Scale, Decision Regret Scale, Decision Conflict Scale, and self-reported evaluations. Descriptive statistics were employed to summarize the data, and subgroup analyses were conducted to identify potential influencing factors. RESULTS: The median age of participants was 46 years. Personal histories of breast cancer were reported in 63.97% (87/136) of the patients, and 8.82% (12/136) were diagnosed with occult ovarian cancer or precancerous lesions post-surgery. Among the cohort, 71.32% (97/136) were postmenopausal. Of the premenopausal patients, only 6 attempted hormone replacement therapy. Anxiety levels and menopausal symptoms were not significantly associated with clinical or demographic variables. Most patients reported low decision regret, with 89.71% (122/136) expressing complete satisfaction with the surgery and only 5.88% (8/136) reporting persistent stress. However, sexual dysfunction was reported by 46.32% (63/136). CONCLUSION: Risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy is associated with significant challenges, particularly concerning sexual dysfunction. These findings underscore the need for comprehensive preoperative counseling that distinctly addresses biomedical, physiological, and psychosocial considerations, alongside postoperative support to manage the quality-of-life impacts of risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy.

10.1038/s41598-023-29478-z	Variations in cochlea shape reveal different evolutionary adaptations in primates	Del Rio J, Taszus R, Nowotny M, Stoessel A	"The presence of a coiled cochlea is a unique feature of the therian inner ear. While some aspects of the cochlea are already known to affect hearing capacities, the full extent of the relationships between the morphology and function of this organ are not yet understood-especially when the effect of body size differences between species is minimized. Here, focusing on Euarchontoglires, we explore cochlear morphology of 33 species of therian mammals with a restricted body size range. Using μCT scans, 3D models and 3D geometric morphometrics, we obtained shape information of the cochlea and used it to build phylogenetically corrected least square models with 12 hearing variables obtained from the literature. Our results reveal that different taxonomic groups differ significantly in cochlea shape. We further show that these shape differences are related to differences in hearing capacities between these groups, despite of similar cochlear lengths. Most strikingly, rodents with good low-frequency hearing display ""tower-shaped"" cochleae, achieved by increasing the degree of coiling of their cochlea. In contrast, primates present relatively wider cochleae and relative better high frequency hearing. These results suggest that primates and rodents increased their cochlea lengths through different morpho-evolutionary trajectories."	Scientific reports	2023 Feb 8
10.1016/j.phrs.2025.107971	Role of cGAS-STING pathway in fibrotic disease.	Feng L, Zhang F, Cao J, Xiong W	The cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS)-stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway serves as a central sensor of cytosolic DNA, orchestrating innate immune responses and maintaining tissue homeostasis. However, dysregulated activation of this signaling cascade has been implicated in chronic inflammation, aberrant tissue remodeling, and the development of fibrosis across multiple organs. Fibrosis, a pathological process characterized by excessive extracellular matrix deposition, underlies progressive dysfunction in the lungs, liver, kidneys, heart, and skin. Recent studies have revealed that abnormal cGAS-STING signaling influences both immune and stromal cell responses, thereby linking DNA sensing to fibrotic progression. In this review, we summarize the current understanding of cGAS-STING in fibrotic diseases, discuss its cellular and molecular mechanisms, and highlight therapeutic strategies targeting this pathway. These insights provide a comprehensive perspective on cGAS-STING as a potential intervention point for diverse fibrotic disorders.	Pharmacological research	2025 Sep 24
10.3390/cells14181458	Tumor-Associated Macrophages in Glioblastoma: Mechanisms of Tumor Progression and	Chen J, Wu Q, Berglund AE, Macaulay RJ, Mulé JJ, Etame AB	Glioblastoma (GBM) is an aggressive brain tumor with a highly immunosuppressive microenvironment that promotes tumor progression and therapy resistance. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), comprising up to 50% of the tumor mass, are recruited via chemokine axes such as CCL2/CCR2, CX3CL1/CX3CR1, and CXCL12/CXCR4 and adopt an M2-like immunosuppressive phenotype, facilitating immune escape and angiogenesis. Key signaling pathways, including CSF1R, STAT3, NF-κB, PI3K/Akt, and HIF-1α, regulate TAM function, making them promising therapeutic targets. Strategies such as TAM depletion, reprogramming, and immune checkpoint blockade (PD-1/PD-L1, and CD47-SIRPα) have shown potential in preclinical models. Emerging approaches, including CAR-macrophage (CAR-M) therapy, nanotechnology-based drug delivery, and exosome-mediated modulation, offer new avenues for intervention. However, clinical translation remains challenging due to GBM's heterogeneity and adaptive resistance mechanisms. Future research should integrate multi-omics profiling and AI-driven drug discovery to refine TAM-targeted therapies and improve patient outcomes.

Combined physical and cognitive activity (PA+CA) programs show promising benefits for MCI patients. Involving adult children through intergenerational approaches may enhance participation and impact, yet little is known about tailoring such programs to both generations' needs. This study aimed to (1) identify cognitive, physical, and psychosocial challenges experienced by MCI patients, and (2) explore the needs, preferences, barriers, and facilitators regarding participation in an intergenerational PA+CA program. A mixed-methods design combined a scoping review of 45 studies with eight semi-structured interviews involving eight MCI patient-adult child dyads. Results highlight challenges such as memory loss, fatigue, social withdrawal, and a desire for meaningful, safe, and structured activities. Barriers included overload, physical limitations, and time constraints; facilitators involved routine, emotional support, and family connection. Findings offer guidance for designing effective intergenerational PA+CA programs. HIGHLIGHTS: A scoping review and interviews identified key challenges in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) across domains. Physical, cognitive, and psychosocial needs were mapped for MCI patients and their children. Barriers to participation included cognitive overload, low motivation, and time constraints. Facilitators included emotional safety, routine, and meaningful family connection. Findings support the design of tailored, intergenerational combined physical and cognitive support programs for MCI.

Defective Ca(2+) handling in cardiac myocytes is recognized as a central pathogenic mechanism underlying both heart failure and atrial and ventricular arrhythmias. In this review, we critically assess the current state of research on Ca(2+)-handling proteins and their role in causing heart failure and arrhythmias, highlighting therapeutic implications. Recent paradigm-shifting discoveries, clinical trial outcomes, and challenges of targeting Ca(2+)-handling proteins are examined. As outlined in this review, an improved understanding of the relevant proteins and their differential expression and function in human health and disease is crucial for developing Ca(2+) handling-targeted therapeutics that can fundamentally alter the natural history of heart failure and arrhythmias.

However, the relationship between the Dietary Index for Gut Microbiota (DI-GM) and the prevalence of CKD has not been fully investigated. METHODS: This study employed data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) from 2007 to 2018, which included 24,962 people, following the DI-GM's eligibility requirements. This study's statistical methodologies included multivariable logistic regression, restricted cubic splines (RCS), subgroup analysis, and interaction tests. RESULTS: Of the 24,962 participants, 4,342 had CKD, representing 17.39% of all participants. The prevalence of CKD exhibited an inverse relationship with CKD, low estimated glomerular filtration rate (low-eGFR), and albuminuria. Specifically, for every one-unit rise in DI-GM, there was a corresponding 5% reduction in CKD prevalence (OR 0.95, 95% CI 0.93 ~ 0.97).

10.3390/ijms26189168	Integrated Analysis, Machine Learning, Molecular Docking and Dynamics of CDK1	Masoudi M, Samadiafshar S, Azizi H, Skutella T	Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) remains one of the deadliest gynecologic malignancies, largely due to late diagnosis and treatment resistance. The main objective of this study is to identify and validate CDK1 as a high-confidence therapeutic target in EOC and to assess the dual-target inhibitory potential of the natural compound Naringin against both CDK1 and its regulator WEE1. This study employed an integrative pipeline combining transcriptomic profiling, protein-protein interaction network analysis, machine learning, and molecular simulations to identify key oncogenic regulators in EOC. CDK1 emerged as a central hub gene, exhibiting strong association with poor prognosis and signaling convergence. CDK1 overexpression correlated with adverse survival outcomes and robust involvement in critical oncogenic pathways. Molecular docking and dynamics simulations assessed the binding efficacy of seven compounds with CDK1 and WEE1, with Naringin showing high-affinity binding, stable complex formation, and minimal predicted toxicity. This study underscores the power of computational-experimental integration in accelerating oncology drug discovery, providing visual and quantitative evidence that systematically connect the study's aim to its findings.
